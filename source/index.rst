Blue Team
=================================================

The blue team is a group focused on protecting assets. This includes monitoring the security
controls, the intrusion detection systems, the logs to protect the assets and identify when a security breach
occurs, and raising security awareness overall (ie make the writeups human-readable for intended audiences).

These are some writeups made on our journeys in a digital landscape formed by nature's own
processes and humanoid activities and neglect throughout decades. Expect some tongue-in-cheek.
