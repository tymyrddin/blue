# SIEM & Threat intelligence/hunting notes

## Whatâ€™s inside?

A curated collection of actionable insights for security analysts, covering:

- SIEM techniques: Query templates, log correlation tricks, and alert-tuning tips.
- Threat intel integration: How to enrich alerts with IoCs (IPs, domains, hashes).
- Hunting methodologies: Proactive search patterns for stealthy threats.

## Why keep these notes?

- Fast reference during investigations: No more Googling "Splunk brute-force query" mid-incident.
- Learn from real attacks: Includes mapped TTPs (e.g., "APT29 often uses PowerShell + DNS tunneling").
- Bridge theory/practice: Converts concepts like MITRE ATT&CK into actual detection rules.
