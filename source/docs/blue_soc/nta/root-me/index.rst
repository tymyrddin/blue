Root-Me NTA challenges: Hands-on cyber ranges
===============================================

The Network Traffic Analysis challenges on Root-Me—our digital obstacle course where packets transform into cryptic
riddles, and every TCP handshake feels like a trapdoor spider waiting to ambush the overconfident. Here we are, armed
with Wireshark’s machete, Zeek’s field notes, and Snort’s growls, yet still getting outsmarted by a 30-byte payload
disguised as 'totally_legit_traffic.pcap'. Is that HTTP traffic? Or a carrier pigeon smuggling AES keys? The logs
remain silent, the clock ticks, and somewhere, a French CTF designer sips espresso, whispering ‘Mais oui, let them
suffer.’ Victory tastes like a freshly decoded XOR string… and the sudden realization you’ve been staring at hex for
4 hours.
