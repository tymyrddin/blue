Network traffic analysis (NTA)
=================================================================

Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) is like cyber-ecology with a packet microscope, sifting through the soil of TCP streams
and UDP spores, hunting for a glint of malicious payloads camouflaged in plain sight. Is that a golden nugget of
exfiltrated data? Or just another false-positive truffle rotting in the SSL undergrowth? Armed with tools like Zeek’s
enzymatic log-breakdown and Wireshark’s spectral analysis, it may be possible to spot the fungal blooms of breaches
before they poison the whole system.
