# Brim

## What is it?

Brim is a modern tool that helps security analysts work faster by combining network logs and packet captures in one 
interface. It takes data from tools like Zeek and Suricata and makes it searchable like a database.

## Why use it?

* Stops the tab overload - No more switching between Wireshark, log files, and other tools
* Finds needles in haystacks - Quickly search through hours of traffic with simple queries
* Connects the dots - See alerts alongside the actual network traffic that triggered them

Typical use: When you get a suspicious IP alert, Brim lets you:

* Immediately find all connections to that IP
* See what protocols were used
* Jump directly to the relevant packets

## How use Brim?
