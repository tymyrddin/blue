# Cyber Defenders digital forensics challenges

## What is it?

Hands-on labs mimicking real breach investigations (memory dumps, disk images, network traces).

## Why try them?

* Realistic evidence: Work with actual attack artifacts.
* Guided learning: Hints keep you from hitting dead ends.
* Community answers: See how others solved the same puzzle.

Typical challenge:

"This ransomware encrypted files—find the attacker’s Bitcoin wallet in the memory dump."
