Digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)
===========================================================

Picture this: Your organization’s server starts moonlighting as a poltergeist—files vanish, logins appear from
"DefinitelyNotHackersVPN.biz", and your firewall’s last message was "lol. reboot me." Enter DFIR (Digital Forensics
& Incident Response), the art of playing cyber-Sherlock while pretending you’re not in a panic.

Hackers leave trails. Your job? Follow their digital banana peels (misconfigured logs, that one unpatched server,
or Dave’s "password123" experiment). It is equal parts archaeology ("Why is there a backdoor from 2012?") and
damage control ("No, CEO, the ransomware probably won’t tweet from your account").
