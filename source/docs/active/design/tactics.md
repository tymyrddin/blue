# Deception tactics (2025 Edition)

Deception tech has evolved, but the principle remains: The best defence is making attackers regret theirs. Now, go 
forth and waste someone’s time.

## Decoys: The art of wasting attackers' time

Decoys exist to lead cybercriminals on a merry dance away from your actual assets. Honeypots and honeynets—carefully crafted digital facades—serve two purposes:

* Annoy attackers by recording their every misstep.
* Educate defenders by revealing their tools, techniques, and (lack of) patience.

The right honeypot depends entirely on your environment and—more importantly—how much schadenfreude you want from your logs.

## @Home: Honeyclients for the curious

A honeyclient pretends to be a tragically outdated browser, eagerly lapping up exploits like a drunk accepting free drinks. Thug remains a delightful weekend project—just don’t blame us when your ISP emails about "suspicious activity."

*Nothing says ‘hobby’ like intentionally infecting a VM for science.*

## Attribution: Because knowing who to ignore is half the battle

Getting attribution is like playing detective, except the suspects leave digital fingerprints everywhere. Useful tools include:

* Document beacons (à la Molehunt) – Because nothing says "gotcha" like a Word file that phones home.
* BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) – Adversaries use it to hijack browsers; defenders use it to turn the tables. "Your JavaScript? Our intelligence."
* HoneyBadger – Not just a meme, but a honeypot with built-in geolocation. Now you can sigh dramatically while pinpointing exactly which country’s cybercafé is bothering you today.

## Traps: The digital labyrinth

Why stop at one honeypot when you can build an entire maze of misery? Tools like:

* Spidertrap – For ensnaring web crawlers in infinite loops of fake pages.
* Weblabyrinth – Because watching bots get lost in procedurally generated nonsense never gets old.
* Nova – A haystack of decoy hosts so convincing, even the attacker starts questioning reality.

*The goal isn’t just to detect—it’s to send them down a rabbit hole with no exit.*
