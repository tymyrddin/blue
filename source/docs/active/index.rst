Active defence
=========================================================

Active defence measures—like IP auto-blocking, tarpitting (slowing down attackers), or counter-hacking
(tracking intruders)—walk a fine line between security and vigilantism.

Warning: Check local laws—some "active" measures (like hacking back) are illegal in many jurisdictions.
