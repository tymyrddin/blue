Honeytech for humans
=============================================================

*Why waste time chasing attackers when you can let them trip over your carefully placed digital banana skins?*

Honeyports (not to be confused with their more famous cousin, honeypots) are the cybersecurity equivalent of rigging a
burglar alarm to a broom cupboardâ€”while the real valuables are elsewhere.

Meanwhile, honeyclients are the overenthusiastic understudies of the security world - they'll happily prance about
pretending to be vulnerable browsers just to see which exploit kits take the bait.
