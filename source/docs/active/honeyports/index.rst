How honeyports turn scans into self-owns
=============================================================

Honeyports (not to be confused with their more famous cousin, honeypots) are the cybersecurity equivalent of rigging a
burglar alarm to a broom cupboard (while the real valuables are elsewhere), or leaving a shiny “Do Not Touch” button in
plain sight on an air-gapped or high-security network, just to see who can’t help themselves.

They’re particularly handy when your Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) is asleep at the wheel, your
Next-Gen firewall isn’t quite as next-gen as advertised, or you're simply tired of zero-days skipping merrily past
your defences.
