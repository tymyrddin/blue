--------------------------------

This is where security begins: three founders, a ramshackle warehouse, and clay golems humming over crystal servers.
Protections are in the process of being created—automation is being tamed, routines are being figured out, and the
golems are learning who is in charge. Any evidence auditors might need is accidental at best, like soot on a
misfired pipe. `Purple crossroads <https://purple.tymyrddin.dev>`_ note where these fledgling measures could satisfy
rules, but the priority is simply keeping the servers running and stopping the golems from causing trouble.
