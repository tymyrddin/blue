Not covered: Audit compliance
---------------------------------

In this scale-up, security is definitely starting to take shape: more golems, larger crystal servers, and a slightly
less ramshackle warehouse. Protections continue being built and tested, automation is finding its rhythm, routines are
being established, and the founders are learning what works before anything breaks. Compliance evidence appears
only as a side effect, like misplaced ledgers on a cluttered desk. `Purple crossroads <https://purple.tymyrddin.dev>`_
show where these measures could satisfy rules, but the driving concern is keeping the systems running and the
golems from revolting.
