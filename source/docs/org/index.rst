Golem Trust Computing operates from a converted fish warehouse near the Shades in Ankh-Morpork. Ponder Stibbons
(former HEX operator at Unseen University) and Adora Belle Dearheart (postal systems expert) provide cloud hosting
for the city's merchant guilds.

They host critical systems for the Patrician's Office, the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork, and merchant guilds across
the Circle Sea. All infrastructure runs on Hetzner Cloud in Finland. Everything is European
or open source.

Not covered: audit compliance
--------------------------------
Each phase focuses on what is actually built: the machinery humming in the back room, the tools that
occasionally spark, the automation that behaves itself most days, and the security woven into daily graft. Once the
real work is done, the evidence more or less accumulates by itself, like paperwork in the Patrician’s antechamber.
Cross references to the `purple crossroads <https://purple.tymyrddin.dev>`_ point out which bits happen to keep
auditors happy, but the real motive is stopping threats.
