The Golem Trust Computing boardroom brims with polished mahogany, glowing arcane displays, and enchanted server orbs wired through ornate clockwork.

Banking customers. Regulations. Advanced threats.

Not covered: Audit compliance
--------------------------------

At enterprise scale, security is starting to solidify across multiple floors of the warehouse, dozens of golems, and
networks of crystal servers. Protections are implemented more systematically: automation runs reliably, routines are
defined, and the founders coordinate efforts to prevent mishaps. Compliance evidence emerges as a side effect.
`Purple crossroads <https://purple.tymyrddin.dev>`_ mark where these measures align with rules, but the main focus
remains keeping the systems operational and ensuring the golems do not stage a rebellion.
