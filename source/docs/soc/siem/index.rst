Security information and event management (SIEM)
=====================================================================

Picture this: your network is a high school, and every device is a student with questionable judgment. The firewall
is the grumpy vice principal, the servers are the overachievers, and Dave from Accounting is... well, Dave.

Enter SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), the sleep-deprived hall monitor who reads every note passed
between devices (even the embarrassing ones), tries to determine if that 3 AM login was a hacker or just Dave
forgetting his password again, but really, spends most of its time saying "That's probably nothing... but what if it's
not?"

Why SIEM? Because cyber threats don't announce themselves with a marching band. They sneak in through the back door
while everyone's distracted by the latest TikTok trend.

Where to start learning? Tools like Splunk and ELK are basically fancy metal detectors - great for finding needles in
haystacks, if you don't mind checking a lot of hay first.
