Blue team @SOC
=====================

Welcome to the SOC team, the Guardians of the Digital Wilds. Below are links to writeups chronicling journeys through
a digital landscape—shaped by nature’s own processes, humanoid activities, and decades of questionable decisions
(we don’t judge, we just patch).

Think of the SOC team as the park rangers of this untamed cyber wilderness. Instead of bears and avalanches, we
battle rogue bots, phishing expeditions, and the occasional existential dread triggered by a SIEM alert at 2 AM.
Our tools? Coffee, keyboard shortcuts, and an unhealthy obsession with log files.

So whether you're here to explore, learn, or just marvel at the chaos—welcome. Just remember: "In the SOC, no one
can hear you scream ... because we’ve all got noise-canceling headphones."
