# NTA challenges

## What is it?

Root-Me's NTA challenges are hands-on exercises where you play detective with real network traffic. You get packet 
captures (PCAPs) and must uncover hidden secrets – like finding stolen data, spotting hacker activity, or cracking 
unusual protocols.

## Why try them?

* Learn by doing – No dry theory, just real traffic to analyze
* Build hacker intuition – Train your eye for suspicious patterns
* Tool mastery – Get comfortable with Wireshark, Zeek, tshark, and other tools through practical use

Typical challenge: 

* Analyze a PCAP to find exfiltrated documents
* Decode unusual DNS tunneling traffic
* Reconstruct a hacker's attack from their network traces

What makes Root-Me special?

* Real-world scenarios – Based on actual attack techniques
* Progressive difficulty – From "baby's first packet" to "CSI: Cyber"
* Instant feedback – Know immediately if your solution works

Perfect for:

* Security newcomers curious about network forensics
* SOC analysts sharpening their skills
* CTF players prepping for competition
