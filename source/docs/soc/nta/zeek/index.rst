Zeek: Transforming raw packets into actionable logs
====================================================

Meet Zeek, the quiet but brilliant tracker in our digital wilderness, silently observing every footstep (or packet)
that crosses its path. While others flashy tools might shout about threats, Zeek just leans against a tree, takes 
meticulous notes, and casually hands you a 300-page scroll titled 'Here’s Exactly How That Hacker Tried to Ruin Your 
Day.' No fanfare, no drama, just cold, hard logs. It’s like having a park ranger who doesn’t just spot bears, but also
documents their favorite berries, nap times, and existential motivations. So while the SOC team runs around putting 
out fires, Zeek’s already written the incident report... in triplicate.
