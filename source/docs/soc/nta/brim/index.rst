Brim: Supercharging network forensics with Zed
==============================================

Brim is the cartographer of our chaotic cyber safari, turning Zeek’s cryptic scrolls and Wireshark’s tangled vines into
something resembling an actual map. With its slick interface, it’s like swapping your scratched-up magnifying glass
for a GPS that actually understands 'Why is this Excel file talking to an IP reserved for RFC 1918 space?' Brim doesn’t
just show you the footprints, it draws a neon arrow screaming ‘HERE’S THE TROUBLE’ while the SOC team collectively
weeps with gratitude. Finally, a tool that treats logs like a treasure hunt instead of a punishment.
