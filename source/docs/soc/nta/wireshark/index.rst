Wireshark: The packet detective’s toolkit
=========================================

Wireshark, the fearless explorer’s machete for hacking through the dense jungle of network traffic. With it, we slice 
through packets like digital vines, uncovering hidden beasts (malware), mysterious whispers (DNS queries), and the 
occasional cryptid (an unencrypted password, just wandering in the clear). Every capture is an expedition: Will we 
find a treasure trove of useful data, or just 10,000 ARP requests from that one printer that really, really wants 
attention?
