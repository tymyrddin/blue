Mobile security: childproofing the digital junk drawer
======================================================================================================

Mitigations:

* Disable app installations from unknown sources (Android).
* Update apps/OS monthly because delayed updates = known exploits.
* Audit app permissions: Revoke camera/microphone access for apps that donâ€™t need it.
* Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi: ProtonVPN or Mullvad are privacy-focused options.
