Computer security: keeping the digital kitchen knives out of reach
======================================================================================================

Mitigations:

* Remove admin rights for daily use: Create a standard user account for family members.
* Enable automatic updates: OS, browsers (Chrome/Firefox), and plugins (Flash/Java).
* Scan downloads with VirusTotal: Before opening files from shady sources.
* Use Task Manager/Activity Monitor: Check for suspicious processes (e.g., unknown.exe chewing CPU).
* Encrypt sensitive files: Use BitLocker (Win), FileVault (Mac), or VeraCrypt (Linux).
