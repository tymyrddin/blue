Router & network security: locking the digital pantry
======================================================================================================

Mitigations:

* Change default credentials: Set a strong password (e.g., CorrectHorseBatteryStaple!).
* Disable remote admin access: Check router settings for "Remote Management" and turn it off.
* Segment IoT devices: Use a guest Wi-Fi network for smart devices (fridge, cameras, etc.).
* Enable WPA3 encryption: Replace WPA2 if your router supports it.
