# MFA Everywhere

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is the #1 way to stop hackers.

## MFA Tools

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is only as strong as the tools you use. Below are the best authenticator apps, hardware keys, and backup strategies to secure your accounts.

### TOTP authenticator apps (Time-Based One-Time Passwords)

These apps generate 6-digit codes that refresh every 30 seconds. Better than SMS (SIM swapping risk).

| Tool	| Pros	| Cons	| Best For |
|-------|----------|-----|---------|
| Aegis (Android)	| Open-source, offline, encrypted backups	| Android-only	| Privacy-focused users |
| Raivo OTP (iOS)	| Open-source, local storage, encrypted exports	| iOS-only	| iPhone users who want security |
| 2FAS (Android/iOS)	| Open-source, encrypted cloud backup	| No desktop app	| Balance of security & convenience |
| Authy (Android/iOS/Desktop)	| Cloud sync, multi-device	| Closed-source, Twilio-owned	| Convenience over max privacy |
| Google Authenticator	| Simple, widely supported	| No backups, no multi-device	| Basic users (but not recommended) |

Recommendation:

* Maximum security? → Aegis (Android) / Raivo (iOS)
* Convenience + backup? → Authy or 2FAS

### Hardware security keys (Strongest MFA)

These physical devices (USB/NFC/Bluetooth) prevent phishing and are the gold standard for MFA.

| Key	* * *   | Pros	* * * * * * * * *   | Cons	* * * * * * | Best For* * *    |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| YubiKey 5 Series	 | FIDO2/U2F, NFC, works with 1000+ services	 | Expensive	* * * *    | Best overall* *    |
| Nitrokey FIDO2	   | Open-source, EU-made	* * * * *   | Fewer services supported	* | Privacy-focused users  |
| Google Titan	*  | Cheaper, good for Google services	* *  | Limited third-party support	 | Google ecosystem users | 
| SoloKey v2	*    | Open-source, USB-C/NFC	* * * * * | Smaller brand	* * *    | Tech enthusiasts*    | 

Where to use hardware keys?

* Google, Facebook, Microsoft, GitHub, Cloudflare
* Crypto (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance)
* Password Managers (Bitwarden, 1Password)

Warning: Always buy directly from the manufacturer (Amazon/eBay may sell tampered keys).

## Backup & Recovery Strategies

Losing MFA access can lock you out forever. Here’s how to avoid it:

Backup methods:

* Print Backup Codes (Google, Facebook, etc. provide them)
* Encrypted Exports (Aegis/Raivo allow encrypted backups)
* Multiple Keys (Register 2 YubiKeys in case one is lost)
* Emergency E-Mail/Phone (Set up fallback methods carefully)

Never Store TOTP Seeds in Cloud Notes/Email!

## Advanced: Passkeys (The future of MFA)

Passkeys (FIDO2) replace passwords with device-based biometrics (fingerprint/face unlock).

Where to use Passkeys?

* Google, Apple, Microsoft, GitHub, PayPal, Best Buy
* Best with: iPhone (iCloud Keychain), Android (Google Password Manager), or YubiKey

Recommendation: Start using passkeys where possible, but keep TOTP/hardware keys as backup.

## Tool recommendations

* For most people: Authy (if you need sync) or Aegis/Raivo (if you prioritize privacy) and YubiKey 5 NFC (for critical accounts)
* For businesses: YubiKey + Duo/Microsoft Authenticator
* For ultra-security: Nitrokey + KeePassXC (TOTP storage)
