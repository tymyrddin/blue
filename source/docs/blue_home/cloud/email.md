# Check email forwarding rules

Why? Hackers secretly forward your emails to themselves. Here are some examples of how to check for suspicious 
forwarding rules in different email providers:

1. Gmail

Settings Path: Click the gear icon → See all settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP

* Check if emails are being forwarded to an unknown address.
* Also check Filters and Blocked Addresses for any hidden rules.

2. Outlook / Microsoft 365

Web Version: Settings → Mail → Forwarding and ensure no unexpected forwarding is enabled.

Desktop Client: File → Manage Rules & Alerts → Check for suspicious rules.

3. Yahoo Mail

Settings Path: Click the gear icon → More Settings → Mailboxes → Check forwarding rules.

4. Apple iCloud Mail

Web Version: Open iCloud.com → Mail → Click the gear icon → Preferences → Rules, and check for any unauthorized forwarding rules.

5. ProtonMail

Settings Path: Settings → Email → Filters → Check for forwarding rules.

6. Zoho Mail

Settings Path: Settings → Mail → Filters → Review forwarding rules.

## Red flags to look for:

* Any forwarding rules you didn’t create.
* Emails being sent to unfamiliar addresses.
* Filters that automatically mark emails as read or delete them.

## What to do if hacked?

* Disable suspicious rules immediately.
* Change your password & enable 2FA.
* Check for other compromised accounts.
