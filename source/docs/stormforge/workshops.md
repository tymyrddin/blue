## Detecting webshells in the wild

Webshells are like hidden stowaways — quiet, adaptable, and able to sabotage from within. In this workshop, the crew 
learns how to search every deck and cargo hold: signatures that whisper, behaviours that betray, and odd patterns in 
the wake. Context matters, whether it is a corporate galleon, an NGO skiff, a public ferry, or a lone sailor’s boat.

**Outcome:** A sharpened eye for spotting intruders trying to blend into the bustle, before they scuttle the ship.
