## SIEM-in-two-days build-a-thon (for NGOs)

A storm-watchtower is no good if it takes years to build. This sprint is about raising a modest but sturdy lookout 
in just two days — a SIEM stack NGOs can actually maintain. Crews will learn to collect logs, parse them into 
usable maps, and set up dashboards that warn when squalls are coming. Collaboration is key: no one builds a 
lighthouse alone.

**Outcome:** A working prototype and the knowledge to raise a watchtower back home with limited timber and rope.

## Pi-Rogue-in-a-day build-a-thon

Every fleet needs small, agile craft — not just lumbering ships. This build-a-thon equips participants with a 
Pi-Rogue, a pocket-sized vessel designed for network exploration and defensive patrols. In one day, the crew sets 
it afloat, configures its sails (toolchains), and practises manoeuvring through hostile waters.

**Outcome:** A personal craft for reconnaissance and defence, ready to be replicated for small crews and NGOs.
