In the heat of a storm, a sturdy ship and a well-prepared crew make all the difference. Stormforge is where
teams come to build both (tools, skills, and instincts) that help navigate turbulent waters. Each session is
a guided voyage: some test your ability to spot hidden dangers, others teach you to raise watchtowers,
patch leaks, or read the changing winds of digital threats.

These workshops, labs, sprints and build-a-thons are designed for small crews, NGOs, and teams facing real-world
uncertainty. You do not need a flagship or a fleet: all exercises can be run with modest equipment and practical
setups, turning chaos into actionable resilience. By the end of the Stormforge journey, participants leave with
working prototypes, sharpened senses, and the confidence to face storms, both foreseen and unexpected.
