# Navigating the waters

## Mapping the waters

**Purpose:** Surface what people see as the currents, rocks, and whirlpools in their shared environment — obstacles, pressures, and hidden dependencies.

**Method:**

* Use a large sheet of paper, whiteboard, or virtual board.
* Participants draw or symbolise elements of their environment: currents (flows of work), rocks (risks or bottlenecks), whirlpools (repeating problems).
* Colour-code for impact, frequency, or urgency.
* Discuss as a group and connect overlapping currents or conflicting rocks.

**Outcome:** A visual map that highlights blind spots, friction points, and opportunities for intervention. Helps teams see the full “sea” they’re navigating.

**Tip:** Encourage creativity — icons, emojis, or metaphors help people express abstract pressures.

## Crossing the river

**Purpose:** Practice decision-making and collaboration when resources are limited and risks are high.

**Method:**

* Divide participants into small crews.
* Present a “river crossing” scenario: only certain steps or resources allow safe passage (time limits, scarce supplies, or conflicting priorities).
* Participants must plan and execute the crossing while negotiating conflicts.
* Debrief: discuss trade-offs, risk perception, leadership emergence, and communication patterns.

**Outcome:** Participants experience the tension of constrained decisions, strengthen collaboration, and learn to surface assumptions.

**Tip:** Introduce “storms” mid-crossing (e.g., a sudden obstacle or new rule) to simulate real-world volatility.

## Storm signals

**Purpose:** Learn to spot weak signals of trouble before they escalate into crises.

**Method:**

* Each participant shares an early-warning story or anomaly they observed in their work or environment.
* Facilitator categorises signals by type, source, or severity.
* Group brainstorms potential responses and ways to monitor similar signals in the future.

**Outcome:** Increased situational awareness, better communication about risks, and a shared framework for identifying early warnings.

**Tip:** Include examples from past storms or incidents to ground abstract signals in concrete experience.

## Anchor points

**Purpose:** Identify stabilising forces that keep the group steady during turbulent times.
**Method:**

* Participants recall moments when the team successfully navigated difficulty.
* Storytelling circle: each shares their perspective.
* Facilitator distils recurring themes into “anchors” — principles, routines, or people the team can rely on.

**Outcome:** Recognising and reinforcing stabilising factors boosts confidence, morale, and resilience during change or uncertainty.

**Tip:** Encourage participants to capture anchors visually (drawings, symbols, or sticky notes) for easy reference later.

## Harbour master exercise

**Purpose:** Test how the group reacts under simulated stress, conflicting information, and communication breakdowns.
**Method:**

* Facilitator introduces a scenario with incomplete or contradictory information.
* Add time pressure or multiple simultaneous demands (“storms” hitting the harbour).
* Observe how participants coordinate, prioritise, and communicate.
* Debrief: highlight patterns of trust, coordination, overload, and improvisation.

**Outcome:** Teams learn stress-handling patterns, identify bottlenecks, and strengthen adaptive responses.

**Tip:** Use role rotation to allow everyone to experience different positions of responsibility.

## Currents and countercurrents

**Purpose:** Explore hidden forces shaping behaviour — policies, culture, or unspoken rules that push or pull the group.
**Method:**

* Participants write down forces that propel the group forward and forces that hold it back.
* Share anonymously or openly, then cluster similar forces.
* Facilitate discussion: why do these forces exist, and how can they be leveraged or mitigated?

**Outcome:** Reveals systemic influences on behaviour, surfaces hidden conflicts, and identifies potential levers for change.

**Tip:** Consider combining with Mapping the Waters so currents identified can be tied to real “rocks” or “whirlpools” in the environment.
