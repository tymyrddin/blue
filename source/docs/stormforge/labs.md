# Tidepool experiments

## Threat intelligence lifecycle lab

Like plotting a course through churning seas, this lab takes participants across the full threat intelligence cycle. 
From spotting distant storm clouds (collection requirements) to charting maps others can actually sail by 
(finished intelligence), the crew learns to separate real signals from crashing waves of noise. Participants will 
work with messy feeds, common misreadings, and shifting winds of adversary behaviour.

**Outcome:** The ability to turn raw chaos into decision-ready bearings. Intelligence you would actually trust at the helm.
