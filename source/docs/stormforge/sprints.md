# Gale sprints

## Patch sprint

A leaky hull will sink even the most majestic ship. This sprint focuses on quick, coordinated patching â€” identifying 
vulnerabilities, prioritising repairs, and sealing breaches before attackers slip through. Participants work in 
squads, racing to patch realistic environments under time pressure, while weathering simulated storms of exploitation 
attempts.

**Outcome:** Practical muscle memory for turning panic into steady damage control, keeping the vessel afloat when holes appear mid-journey.
