# Gale sprints

## Patch sprint

A leaky hull will sink even the most majestic ship. This sprint focuses on quick, coordinated patching, identifying 
vulnerabilities, prioritising repairs, and sealing breaches before attackers slip through. Participants work in 
squads, racing to patch realistic environments under time pressure, while weathering simulated storms of exploitation 
attempts.

**Outcome:** Practical muscle memory for turning panic into steady damage control, keeping the vessel afloat when holes appear mid-journey.
