# Guides to bank privacy settings and credit freeze systems (2025)

Financial abuse occurs in 99% of intimate partner violence cases, with abusers often exploiting bank access, credit 
systems, and personal data to maintain control. Here we cover:  

- Locking down bank accounts against unauthorized access  
- Freezing credit to prevent fraudulent loans/accounts  
- EU vs. UK legal protections and how to use them

## Securing bank accounts  

### Immediate actions  

- Change online banking passwords: Use a 12+ character mix (e.g., `Coffee!Mug#2025`). Avoid personal details (birthdays, pet names).  
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Require a code from your phone *and* a password for logins.  
- Revoke shared access: Remove ex-partners as authorized users or joint account holders. UK banks must comply within 24 hours under FCA rules.  

### Privacy settings to adjust  

| Setting            | Why It Matters                                          | How to Change                              |  
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| Transaction alerts | Get SMS/email for withdrawals >€10                      | Mobile app → Notifications → Custom alerts |  
| Card controls      | Block international/online spending                     | Online banking → Card settings → Limits    |  
| Account visibility | Hide accounts from shared dashboards (e.g., Monzo Pots) | App → Privacy → Hide balance               |  

If these are not available, call your bank.

UK-Specific: Under the Financial Conduct Authority’s Consumer Duty, banks must proactively support vulnerable 
customers—request "enhanced security" if you fear coercion.

## Credit freezes: step-by-step  

A freeze blocks lenders from accessing your credit report, stopping abusers from opening loans in your name.  

### How to freeze (free in EU/UK)

1. Contact all three bureaus (UK) or your bank (EU):  
   - Experian: [www.experian.co.uk/freeze](https://www.experian.co.uk/freeze) or call +44 800 013 8888  
   - Equifax: Online portal or +44 800 587 1584  
   - TransUnion: [www.transunion.co.uk/credit-freeze](https://www.transunion.co.uk/credit-freeze)   

2. Provide:  
   - Full name, address, birthdate  
   - Proof of address (utility bill)  
   - National Insurance number (UK) / Social Security number (EU)  

3. Receive a PIN/password to unfreeze later. Store it securely (e.g., password manager).  

EU Advantage: GDPR grants right to restrict processing—demand credit bureaus suppress your data entirely.

## Monitoring for abuse

### Red flags

- Unfamiliar accounts on your credit report  
- Small test transactions (€1–€5) to verify card access  
- Password reset emails you didn’t request  

### Tools 

- [Credit Karma (UK)](https://www.creditkarma.com/): Free weekly credit score checks   
- [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/): Scan for leaked passwords/emails

## Legal protections by region

| Issue                 | UK                                      | EU                              |  
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| Bank account freezing | 48-hour notice required (except fraud)  | Immediate under GDPR Article 17 |  
| Credit freeze cost    | Free                                    | Free                            |  
| Data access           | SAR (Subject Access Request) in 30 days | GDPR response in 15 days        |  

Key Difference: EU banks must auto-delete unused data after 3 years; UK allows retention for "legitimate interests".

## Special cases

### For shared accounts

- UK: Request a "financial abuse marker" on accounts—triggers extra verification for withdrawals.  
- EU: Use PSD2’s "strong customer authentication" to require biometric approval for payments.  

### If your abuser works at a bank 

- File a DSAR (Data Subject Access Request) to audit who accessed your data.  
- Switch to a bank with branch-level privacy (e.g., Metro Bank in UK verifies ID in-person for sensitive changes).
