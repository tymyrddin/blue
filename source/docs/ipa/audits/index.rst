Personal device audits for safety and control
===============================================

When someone’s personal device may have been tampered with — especially in the context of intimate partner abuse (IPA)
— time and clarity matter. These audits are designed for real-world use: by survivors, advocates, and frontline workers.
No tech jargon. No assumptions. Just practical steps to check for warning signs across Android, iPhone, Windows, Mac,
Linux, and BSD systems.

Each guide walks through the process of spotting suspicious apps, permissions, or access tools — using only what’s
already on the device or carried in on a safe USB. They don’t require advanced skills, but they do take a careful eye
and a few minutes of quiet focus.

These audits are not about "fixing everything" — they’re about giving people back control and helping them make
informed decisions about next steps.
