# Important notes on hands-on device checking

When Lisa left her abusive partner, she didn't realise he'd installed tracking software on her tablet that recorded 
every website she visited. Like many survivors, she only discovered the spyware when applying for housing support - 
the shelter's tech volunteer found three hidden tracking apps.  

Device audits help survivors:  

- Regain privacy by finding hidden tracking software  
- Secure evidence for legal cases against abusers  
- Feel confident their communications are truly private  

---

## What you'll need for basic checks 

1. A clean computer (one the abuser never accessed)  
2. A USB drive (16GB or larger)  
3. Free detection tools (listed below)  
4. Paper and pen to document findings  

*Budget note:* Many women's shelters now have "tech safety kits" with these items pre-prepared.  

## Preparing your tools safely  

On a clean computer: 

1. Download these free tools onto your USB drive:  
   - Malwarebytes (malwarebytes.com) - detects commercial spyware  
   - PiRogue Toolkit (pts-project.org) - finds hidden tracking apps  
   - USB WriteProtector (avoid accidental file changes)  

2. Disconnect from Wi-Fi before inserting the USB into any device being checked  

*Safety note:* Always use public library computers or shelter devices for downloads if your personal devices might 
be compromised.

## Documenting findings  

Create a simple log with:  
- Date/time of audit  
- Devices checked  
- Suspicious items found  
- Actions taken  

*Example: "15/3/2025 - Samsung Galaxy A12 - Found 'TrackView' app with location permissions. Uninstalled and reset location settings."*
