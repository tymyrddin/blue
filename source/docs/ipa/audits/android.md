# Checking an Android phone for spyware or suspicious apps

If you’re helping someone who suspects their Android phone might be monitored, here’s a practical, non-technical 
guide you can use to check for signs of tracking or spyware. You don’t need to be a tech expert — just take your 
time and follow these steps carefully.

## 1. Install Malwarebytes from a USB stick

If you can’t trust the phone’s app store, it’s safest to install a known antivirus tool manually. You’ll need:

* A USB stick with the **Malwarebytes APK** file already downloaded (from the official Malwarebytes website)
* A USB OTG adapter (lets you plug the USB stick into the phone)

**Here’s how:**

1. Plug the USB stick into the phone using the adapter.
2. Open the **Files** app (sometimes called "My Files" or “File Manager”).
3. Find the Malwarebytes file — it ends in `.apk`.
4. Tap it. You’ll get a warning about installing apps from “Unknown Sources.”
5. Follow the prompt to **temporarily allow** this. It’s safe if you trust the source (i.e. your USB stick).

*Once installed, you can remove the permission again for extra safety.*

## 2. Run a full scan

1. Open **Malwarebytes**.
2. Tap **Scan**.
3. Wait about 10–15 minutes while it checks the whole phone.

It will alert you if it finds anything dodgy — malware, spyware, or apps behaving badly behind the scenes.

## 3. Check for suspicious apps

Even if Malwarebytes doesn’t find anything, it’s worth having a look yourself.

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Go to **Apps** or **Apps & notifications**.
3. Tap **See all apps** or **Manage apps**.
4. If needed, tap the three dots in the corner and select **Show system apps**.

Now scroll through the list. You’re looking for anything that:

* Has odd names like “SystemService” or random letters (e.g., “xzy.track.android”)
* Includes words like **track**, **monitor**, **spy**, **remote**, or **stealth**
* Pretends to be something harmless, like a calculator or notepad

*A Manchester shelter found 17 phones with “KidsGuard Pro” hidden behind fake calculator icons. No one had noticed until permissions and background activity gave it away.*

If you see something strange and don’t know what it is, make a note and look it up later — or ask a tech support person you trust.


## 4. Review app permissions

Sometimes the apps themselves aren’t suspicious — but what they’re allowed to do *is*.

Here’s how to check:

1. In **Settings**, go to **Apps** again.
2. Tap **App permissions** or **Permissions manager**.
3. Go through categories like **Location**, **Microphone**, **Camera**, **SMS**, and **Phone**.
4. Ask: *Does this app really need access to this?*

If a weather app or calculator has microphone access, that’s a red flag.

You can **revoke** permission by tapping the app and selecting **Don’t allow** or **Deny**.

## Notes

If you’re ever unsure about an app or can’t tell what it’s doing, it’s safer to block its permissions or remove it 
altogether — especially on a phone used by a survivor.

And write things down. Keep a record of what you find in case you need to report it to law enforcement or a support 
organisation.
