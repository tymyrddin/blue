# Checking Windows computers for monitoring or spyware

Windows machines can be vulnerable to all sorts of digital tampering — from keyloggers to remote control tools. This 
guide walks you through how to check a Windows laptop or desktop safely, even if you’re not especially tech-savvy.

If you're supporting someone in an IPA context, especially after a partner had access to their computer, these steps 
can help detect common signs of surveillance.

## 1. Run Malwarebytes from a USB stick

To be safe, don’t install anything directly on a suspicious machine. Instead, run a **portable** version of a trusted 
antivirus tool.

**What you’ll need:**

* A USB stick with the **Malwarebytes portable scanner** downloaded from a clean, safe computer beforehand.

**Steps:**

1. Plug the USB into the Windows machine.
2. Open **File Explorer** and double-click the Malwarebytes file.
3. Follow prompts to **run the scanner without installing**.
4. Let it do a full scan (this may take 15–30 minutes).
5. If anything suspicious is found, choose **Quarantine** to isolate it.

*This avoids tipping off any spyware that might be monitoring new installations.*

## 2. Look for signs of a keylogger or remote control

Keyloggers record everything typed — including passwords and private messages — and can be invisible unless you know where to look.

**Here’s a basic check:**

1. Press **Ctrl + Alt + Delete**.
2. Click **Task Manager**.
3. In the **Processes** tab, look at what’s using a lot of CPU or memory.

**What to look for:**

* Names that don’t make sense (e.g., “sysmon.exe” or “winlogsvc” — anything that isn’t part of normal Windows use).
* Software you don’t recognise, especially if it’s running in the background constantly.
* Tools like **TeamViewer**, **AnyDesk**, or **Chrome Remote Desktop** that allow someone else to control the machine remotely.

*Shelter tip: In Liverpool, advocates found abusers using Chrome Remote Desktop to stay connected to survivors’ machines — even after breakups.*

If something looks dodgy, note the name and do a quick search from a separate, trusted device to see if it’s legitimate.

## 3. Review browser extensions

Browsers are a common entry point for monitoring tools — especially extensions that appear harmless but can track 
everything the user does online.

**For Chrome:**

1. Open Chrome.
2. Type `chrome://extensions` into the address bar and press Enter.
3. Go through the list of extensions.

**What to look for:**

* Anything the person didn’t knowingly install
* Tools with vague names like “Web Helper,” “Video Downloader,” or “Search Enhancer”
* Extensions with permissions like “Read and change all your data on websites you visit”

Click **Remove** on anything suspicious. If in doubt, better to remove it — it can always be reinstalled later if legitimate.

## Notes

* If someone is worried the machine is deeply compromised, consider doing sensitive work (like account changes) on a different device entirely.
* Keep a written or photographed record of anything suspicious, especially if reporting to law enforcement or support services.

*Spyware doesn’t always show up loudly. It often relies on invisibility. So quiet investigation like this can make all the difference.*
