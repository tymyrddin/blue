IPA workshops
==================

Digital threats are now a common feature of abuse — whether it’s covert tracking, stolen passwords, or manipulated
media. But too often, survivors are left to fend for themselves in a world of vague advice and technical confusion.

These open-source workshops are designed to change that.

They’re written for non-techies, co-developed with advocates and survivors, and structured to be delivered in any
shelter, community space, or support group. Each one is modular, adaptable, and built around real threats people face
— with exercises that help participants build confidence, skills, and trust in their instincts.

Everything is open and remixable — from slide decks and facilitator notes to handouts and offline copies. No licenses,
no vendor lock-in, and no assumptions that you’ve got perfect Wi-Fi or ten laptops handy.

Just practical learning, designed for where people are — not where tech companies think they should be.
