# Spotting spyware and stalkerware: Taking back control of your device

Duration: 90 minutes (can be shortened or split over two sessions)

Who it is for: Survivors, advocates, shelter workers, and community members. No prior tech knowledge needed.

Workshop goals: By the end of the session, participants will:

* Understand what spyware and stalkerware are, and how they’re used in abusive relationships
* Recognise red flags that suggest a device might be compromised
* Learn how to do a basic check of a smartphone or computer
* Know what not to do (to avoid tipping off an abuser)
* Feel more confident in deciding what to do next — and where to find support

## Session outline

### 1. Welcome & framing (10 minutes)

* Quick check-in, outline goals, set a non-judgemental tone
* Explain that this is about awareness, not paranoia
* Emphasise control: “You decide what steps to take — this is your space.”

### 2. What is stalkerware? (15 minutes)

A short, accessible explanation:

* Spyware or stalkerware is software that lets someone secretly watch what you do on your phone or computer — texts, location, photos, even microphone use
* It’s often installed by someone with physical access, like a partner or family member
* Sometimes disguised as calculator apps, safety tools, or even kids’ games

*Keep this grounded. Use stories, not scary tech language.*

### 3. Signs something might be wrong (10 minutes)

Facilitator-led discussion (use a whiteboard or sticky notes):

* Battery drains quickly?
* Phone hot when not in use?
* Location always “on”?
* Unknown apps with weird names?
* Someone “knows things” they shouldn’t?
* You feel watched — and it’s not in your head

→ Handout: Red Flags Checklist: Printable, discreet, easy to tuck into a bag.

### 4. Hands-on: Device audits (30 minutes)

Split into breakout pairs or small groups (depending on numbers). Use safe test devices (not personal ones unless 
someone *really* wants to). Guided walkthroughs for:

* [Android audit](../audits/android.md): Using an APK from USB, check for spyware, review permissions
* [iPhone audit](../audits/iphone.md): Look for profiles, battery use, permission settings
* [Windows audit](../audits/windows.md): Look at login processes, extensions, odd users
* [Mac audit](../audits/mac.md): Look at login processes, extensions, odd users
* [Linux/BSD (optional)](../audits/nix.md): A very short version, or facilitator demo only

Facilitators rotate and help — this is a supported activity, not a test.

*Everything is in plain language, using offline handouts. No need for internet access.*

### 5. What *not* to do (5 minutes)

Important safety notes:

* Don’t delete apps without thinking — might alert the abuser
* Don’t confront abusers immediately
* Don’t change all passwords at once if they have physical access
* Document first — then decide what to do

→ Sheet: What Not To Do (and why): Helps avoid common mistakes when panic hits.

### 6. What next? (10 minutes)

* How to get a second opinion safely (trusted tech ally, IPA Digital Safety Lab, digital rights orgs)
* How to collect evidence, if it’s safe
* Who can help: local shelters, legal clinics, digital support groups

### 7. Closing round (10 minutes)

* Invite participants to share one thing they’re taking away
* Offer space to talk one-to-one afterwards if anyone needs it
* Share printed or offline-accessible guides

## Materials included

* Printable device check guides (Android, iPhone, Windows, Mac, Linux)
* Red flag checklist
* Tip sheet: What not to do
* List of resources (organisations, apps, digital defenders)
* Slide deck (optional — use printed version if no projector)

## Notes for facilitators

* Respect emotion — this is a charged topic. Some may realise mid-session they’ve been targeted.
* Leave space for people to step back, or ask questions in private
* Reassure — tech is intimidating, but this isn’t about perfection. It’s about awareness and options.
* Avoid victim-blaming language. Focus on what people *can* do, not what they "should’ve done".
