# Safer communication habits

*Reducing digital risks in everyday survivor support*

This session helps participants recognise unsafe digital communication practices, introduces safer alternatives, and builds confidence in guiding survivors through common choices—like what to text, where to call from, and how to use their phones without being watched.

Duration: 1.5 hours (ideal for groups with limited time, but can be expanded to 2–2.5 hours with demos and casework)

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

* Identify common surveillance risks in calls, texts, and apps
* Understand how abusers monitor communication
* Recommend safer tools and techniques without increasing risk
* Create “situational comms plans” for survivors based on threat level
* Use simple methods to verify secure channels (without sounding paranoid)

## Target audience

* Shelter staff
* Support workers
* Outreach volunteers
* Advocates and legal aides
* Survivors in digital safety programmes

## Materials needed

* Flipchart, markers
* Phones (dummy or real), laptops for roleplay
* Printed “Comms threat cards”
* Sticky notes, pens
* Optional: demo tools (Signal, Briar, GrapheneOS device, Faraday pouch, PiRogue device)

## Structure

### Part 1: Digital risk awareness *(20 mins)*

#### Topics

* How abusers monitor communications:

  * Spyware/stalkerware
  * Cloud sync and device mirroring
  * Shared accounts, family plans
  * Physical access (guessing passcodes, reading messages directly)
* The myth of “just use WhatsApp”—when it’s *not* safe

#### Activity

* “Guess the risk” card sort: Groups sort example comms methods from “safe-ish” to “high risk” (e.g. SMS, Facebook Messenger, Signal, landline, public Wi-Fi call, email, voice notes)

### Part 2: Safer Tools, Safer Behaviour *(30 mins)*

#### Topics

* Principles of safer communication:

  * Keep it temporary, anonymous, encrypted, or redundant
  * No app is 100% safe; behaviour matters
* Tool recommendations:

  * Signal (secure, but requires installing on trusted device)
  * Briar (offline, Bluetooth-based)
  * Phone box or burner SIMs (context-dependent)
  * Notes app + verbal code (low-tech workarounds)

#### Demo

* Signal: how to verify safety numbers
* Burner phone setup: how to separate personal and safe comms

#### Handout

* “Safe-ish Apps & Tools” table with pros/cons and when to use each

### Part 3: Situational Comms Planning *(20 mins)*

#### Activity

* “You’re Supporting Jamie”
  A survivor, Jamie, has reason to suspect her phone is monitored. In pairs, participants:

  * Identify her top communication needs (talking to a solicitor, contacting a sibling, checking housing)
  * Choose safer options for each
  * Map out a one-week comms plan using available tools and locations

Debrief on choices: why this app over that one? What trade-offs were made?

### Part 4: Making it stick—Teaching survivors *(15 mins)*

#### Topics

* How to explain risks without causing fear or shame
* Checking for understanding (“What would you do if…?”)
* When *not* to change habits suddenly (abuser may notice)
* Coaching gently: "Here's a trick I've used..."

#### Roleplay

* Quickfire: You have 2 minutes to explain to a survivor how to contact a lawyer without tipping off their partner. Go.

### Wrap-up & Q\&A *(10 mins)*

* Recap key behaviours:

  * Use safer apps when possible
  * Don’t leave traces (or know how to clean up safely)
  * Avoid suspicious patterns or “sudden silence”
  * Talk *about* comms before using comms
* Share local resources:

  * Places with open Wi-Fi
  * Shelters with burner devices
  * Tech support orgs

#### Handout

* “Comms Red Flags & Safe Practices” tear-away guide
* Situational planning worksheet survivors can take home (anonymised)

## Optional add-ons

* Drop-in tech desk: Let participants bring phones and ask “is this safe?” in private
* App lab: Safe setup of secure messengers on test devices
* Privacy clinic: Show how to remove metadata, hide apps, or change SIMs
