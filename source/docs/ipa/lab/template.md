**Project title:**

IPA Lab: Digital safety and empowerment for survivors of Intimate Partner Abuse (IPA)

**Project summary:**

The IPA lab is a survivor-focused, community-based initiative designed to improve digital safety for individuals 
experiencing Intimate Partner Abuse (IPA). By providing practical, low-cost, on-premises digital infrastructure, the 
project equips shelters, community groups, and service providers with tools to detect, prevent, and respond to digital 
surveillance, stalking, and abuse.

**Problem statement:**

Digital abuse is an escalating tactic in IPA. Survivors face threats not just physically, but through phones, apps, 
spyware, and online accounts. However, many shelters and frontline services lack the resources or expertise to address 
this growing digital threat. The IPA Lab fills this gap by offering a do-it-yourself, privacy-preserving security 
system that can run locallyâ€”without depending on costly external providers or exposing sensitive data.

**Objectives:**

* Equip shelters and NGOs with a free, open-source digital safety toolkit
* Build the capacity of support workers to identify and respond to digital threats
* Empower survivors through informed, trauma-aware digital self-defence
* Promote digital sovereignty and privacy for vulnerable communities

**Target audience:** Shelters, refuges, frontline workers, grassroots support networks, and survivors of IPA, 
especially those in underfunded or rural settings across the UK and EU.

**Activities:**

* Development and maintenance of the IPA-SIEM (Security Information & Event Management) system
* Creation of easy-to-understand, multilingual guides and training materials
* Collaboration with local shelters to deploy test environments
* Workshops for support staff on identifying signs of digital tracking, spyware, and data leaks

**Funding will support:**

* Hardware (e.g. laptops, routers, storage)
* Translation and accessibility services
* Training delivery and community outreach
* System development and technical support
* Evaluation and research to assess impact

**Outcomes:**

* Safer digital environments for survivors
* Stronger capacity for frontline organisations to support digital abuse cases
* A replicable model for community-led digital safety in domestic abuse response

**Why now:** [As intimate partner abuse increasingly intersects with digital life](../landscape.md), digital safety has 
become a human right. The IPA lab meets this moment with pragmatic, grassroots tools that prioritise autonomy, privacy, 
and care.
