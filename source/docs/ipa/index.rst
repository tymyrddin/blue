A project, together with `Meltem Arikan <https://www.meltemarikan.com/>`__, sponsored by `/ut7 <https://ut7.fr/>`__ for
supporting Intimate Partner Abuse survivors in various ways:

* Keeping up with the digital stalking threat landscape
* Asking IPA survivors as the domain experts for co-developing up-to-date guides on detecting and countering digital stalking.
* Designing and facilitating workshops which include hands-on exercises on digital stalking, and roleplays on dealing with law enforcement in local contexts.
* Developing labs for shelters and health care professionals supporting survivors, to do mobile testing and forensics using open source tools such as the PiRogue suite.
* Supporting interested parties in using such labs to support survivors.
