# Keeping up with the digital stalking threat landscape (2025)

The digital stalking epidemic continues to grow at an alarming rate, with projections suggesting nearly a quarter of 
internet users - that's about 9 million people - may experience cyberstalking by 2025. This represents a steady 5% 
annual increase, largely fuelled by our ever-expanding digital footprints. What's particularly troubling is that in 
about 70% of cases, the victim actually knows their stalker, often living with the constant fear that online 
harassment could escalate to physical harm. These patterns mirror the disturbing real-life dynamics recently 
portrayed in popular media like Baby Reindeer.  

Perhaps most concerning is the underreporting crisis - only about one in ten cases ever gets formally reported. 
The reasons for this silence are complex, ranging from fear of retaliation to simple lack of awareness about 
legal options. This creates a dangerous gap where perpetrators operate with impunity, and survivors suffer in isolation.

## Common attack vectors  

When it comes to digital stalking methods, the classics never go out of style. Text messages, emails and phone calls 
remain the weapons of choice for many stalkers - low-tech perhaps, but frighteningly effective. These familiar formats 
can make the harassment feel more personal and immediate.  

But stalkers are increasingly supplementing these with more sophisticated tools. Social media platforms have become 
playgrounds for harassment through fake accounts and doxxing. The smart devices in our homes - cameras, thermostats, 
even baby monitors - can be turned against us for covert surveillance. And then there's the particularly insidious 
category of stalkerware - commercial spyware like Cerberus or FlexiSpy that can be secretly installed on a victim's 
device, giving the perpetrator complete access to messages, location data and more.  

## Emerging threats  

The stalker's toolkit is getting an AI upgrade. Voice cloning technology now allows perpetrators to create convincing 
impersonations, potentially for gaslighting or social engineering. Deepfake technology enables new forms of blackmail 
using synthetic intimate imagery. It's like the worst parts of science fiction becoming someone's daily reality.  

Financial stalking represents another disturbing trend, with abusers exploiting open banking APIs to monitor 
transactions and maintain financial control. We're also seeing more cross-platform harassment campaigns, where 
abusers coordinate attacks across messaging apps, gaming platforms and encrypted services, making the harassment 
both inescapable and harder to document.  

## Gaps in current defences  

Our legal systems are struggling to keep pace with these evolving threats. Inconsistent international laws create 
a patchwork of protections, allowing stalkers to exploit jurisdictional gaps. The technology itself often works 
against victims - default device settings prioritise convenience over privacy, leaving many vulnerable without 
realising it.  

While excellent open-source tools like PiRogue exist, they haven't achieved mainstream adoption in shelters and 
support services. There's also a critical awareness gap - many survivors and even professionals underestimate how 
much revealing data we leave in digital breadcrumbs, from photo metadata to location histories.  

## IPA project priorities  

For text and email harassment, we're focusing on [secure communication protocols](guides/secure-comms.md) and [practical 
exercises in documenting evidence for law enforcement](guides/doc-evidence.md). Location tracking threats are met with 
[GPS spoofing techniques](guides/gps-spoofing.md) and 
[hands-on device audits](audits/audits.md) using tools like PiRogue in our [shelter labs](lab/index.rst).  

The rise of AI abuse has led to [developing deepfake detection drills](workshops/detection-drills.md), teaching people to spot 
the subtle artifacts in synthetic media. Financial surveillance gets special attention too, with clear [guides to bank 
privacy settings and credit freeze systems](guides/banks.md).  

## Key takeaways for survivor support  

Our approach emphasises moving from fear to practical agency. We've found great value in simple, actionable steps 
like our "how to lock down a smartphone in 10 minutes" guide. Working with law enforcement requires understanding 
local reporting barriers - whether that's navigating Turkey's Law No. 6284 or the EU's Digital Services Act.  

A major focus is expanding access to open-source tools through training programmes for shelter staff. Being able 
to perform basic device forensics can make all the difference in building a case or simply giving someone back 
their sense of security. After all, in the fight against digital stalking, knowledge isn't just power - it's 
protection.
