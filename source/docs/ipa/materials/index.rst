Collection of workshop support materials
==========================================

Welcome to the back room. These materials are for facilitators, organisers, and the sort of participants who read the
footnotes for fun.

Here you’ll find tools and templates to adapt workshops to your context—whether you’re running a digital safety
session in a community centre, a training for front-line workers, or a tactical exercise in a classroom full of
sceptical teenagers.

The aim is not just to teach, but to create space where people can experiment, question, and sometimes laugh at how
ridiculous surveillance tech can be. All while building the kind of practical skills that keep people safer.

Use what works, adapt what doesn’t, and if you invent something brilliant—please share it.
