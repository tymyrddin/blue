# Crafting fake videos

**How fake videos are made—and how to spot them**

Fake videos can feel very real. Abusers sometimes use them to scare, blackmail, or humiliate. These might show you 
doing or saying something you never did—or claim you were somewhere you weren’t.

This guide shows **how fakes are made**, not so you can make them, but so you can understand what’s possible, what’s 
not, and how to protect yourself. It’s for anyone who’s ever asked: *"How do I know what’s real?"*

## Types of fake videos

### Deepfakes

These are videos made using artificial intelligence (AI). Your face is copied and placed onto someone else’s body.

* **Example:** You appear in a sexual video—but it’s not you, it just looks like you.
* **How it's done:** Someone gathers photos or short clips of your face and feeds them into software that learns how you look and move.
* **Signs to watch for:**

  * The eyes don’t blink naturally
  * The voice is slightly out of sync with the lips
  * Hair or jawlines look slightly blurry or odd
  * Background lighting changes strangely

### Edited clips ("Shallowfakes")

These are quicker and easier. Someone takes a real video but cuts, slows, or rearranges parts to change the meaning.

* **Example:** You’re shown in a conversation, but key parts are removed to make you look guilty or aggressive.
* **How it's done:** Basic phone or laptop video editors can do this in minutes.
* **Signs to watch for:**

  * Sudden jumps in video
  * Different background sounds mid-sentence
  * Your voice or tone changes unnaturally

### Voiceovers and talking heads

Someone takes a photo and makes it look like the person is talking using an AI-generated voice.

* **Example:** A video where a person who looks like you says something you never said.
* **How it's done:** Free tools online can turn photos into moving faces with fake voices.
* **Signs to watch for:**

  * The speech sounds too flat or robotic
  * Lips move but don't match the words exactly
  * No breathing or background sounds

## How are fake videos made? (for workshop learning only!)

**Please don’t try this on real people.** These steps are to help learn, spot fakes, and support others.

### 1. Create a made-up person

Use a fake face generator so you’re not using real images of anyone.

   * [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com) – instantly generates realistic faces
   * [Generated Photos](https://generated.photos/faces) – gives you more control over expressions and age

Download one image to use for the next step.

### 2. Make them talk

Choose how realistic or advanced you want your fake to be.

**Easy, browser-based tools:**

* [D-ID](https://www.d-id.com/) – type text and it animates the face
* [HeyGen](https://www.heygen.com/) – excellent lip sync with pre-set avatars
* [DeepBrain](https://www.deepbrain.io/) – polished but commercial platform

**More technical (for advanced users):**

* [DeepFaceLab (Windows/Linux)](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab) – very powerful but complex
* [FaceSwap (macOS/Linux/Windows)](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap) – open source with active community

Upload your generated face, and either record your own voice or type in the message.

### 3. Add a voice 

* Use your own voice: Record using your phone or a free audio app (like Audacity)
* Or generate speech using text:

  * [Murf.ai](https://murf.ai/) – good range of voices
  * [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) – very realistic, free for short clips

Download the audio and upload it into the video tool, or let the platform handle it.

### 4. Make it look odd on purpose

You want the video to feel fake—so others can learn to spot the signs.

   * Use [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/) or [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) (both free) to blur the background or add odd effects
   * Add jumps or pauses, distort the voice, or tweak the lighting
   * Deliberately mismatch the lips and voice, or add flickers to the eyes

Save your final fake video.

### 5. Show it in a session

Play the video and invite observations:

* **Does it feel real?** What made it convincing?
* **What’s missing or off?** Eyes? Shadows? Background noise?
* **What tricks did the creator use?** Would someone believe it if they didn’t know better?

Encourage discussion:

* What makes a fake video *believable*?
* How could someone protect themselves from this kind of manipulation?
* What are ethical red lines when demonstrating this?

Finish with a walkthrough of exactly how the fake was made—tools, time, and tell-tale signs.

## How to respond if you see a fake

* **Save a copy**: Download it and keep a note of where and when you saw it
* **Don’t share it more**: This just spreads the harm
* **Get help**: Show it to a digital support worker or trusted advocate
* **Look for clues**: Bad editing, missing shadows, weird mouth movement, no background sounds
* **Tell your circle**: Friends and colleagues can also learn how to spot fakes

## Facilitator notes (for running sessions)

* Let participants know **being fooled isn’t failure**. These tools are *designed* to be tricky.
* Allow space for feelings—fake videos are upsetting, especially if you’ve been targeted before.
* Use fictional characters or stock images to avoid personal harm.
* After showing a fake, always explain exactly how it was made.

Fake videos are powerful, but so is knowledge. Once you’ve seen how they work, they’re easier to spot—and harder to 
believe. This guide gives you the tools to protect yourself, support others, and feel more in control of your own story.

You're not paranoid. You're paying attention. That’s a skill worth having.
