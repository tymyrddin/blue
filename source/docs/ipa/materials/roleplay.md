# Roleplay setups

**Guides for running fictional scenarios that explore threat models, attacker behaviour, and what happens when things go sideways**

These roleplay guides are designed to help workshop participants explore what digital threats *look like in practice*. They’re fictional, anonymised, and flexible—but they’re built from real patterns seen in cases of intimate partner abuse. Each scenario introduces:

* **A situation** (someone in trouble)
* **A threat model** (what’s at risk, from whom)
* **A challenge** (what went wrong or is about to)
* **Choices** (what might make things better or worse)

They’re meant to be talked through, acted out, argued over, and rebuilt. You don’t need drama school 
qualifications—just curiosity, a willingness to imagine what it feels like to be in someone else’s digital skin, 
and respect for the emotional weight of the material.

## How to use roleplay in workshops

### Choose your format

* **Quickfire decision trees** – present a scenario and pause at key decisions. What would you do next? Why?
* **Split groups** – one side roleplays “defenders”, the other “attackers” (or the abuser’s tactics). Debate strategy.
* **Timeline breakdowns** – map out what happened over time. Where were the red flags? Where could action have helped?
* **Full improvisation** – ideal for confident groups: act out the scenario live, with a facilitator moderating the flow.

### Prep the ground

* Remind everyone: *these are fictional scenarios, but they reflect real risks.* Participants are free to step out or opt out at any time.
* Set ground rules: respect, confidentiality, no laughing at anyone’s discomfort.
* If possible, have a peer support worker or mental health contact on hand.

### Debrief like it matters

* Always follow with a group discussion.
* Ask what surprised people. What felt real? What would they do differently next time?
* Let people air emotions, frustrations, and connections to their own experiences—but don’t push for disclosures.

## Scenario ideas (examples)

### *“He set up my new phone.”*

**Threat model:** The abuser installed remote access tools on the target’s new phone under the guise of “helping.”

**Challenge:** They’ve since left, but the phone battery drains quickly, random pop-ups occur, and GPS is always mysteriously on.

**Roleplay angle:** Defenders brainstorm how to detect and remove spyware without tipping off the attacker (who still has shared custody of a child).

### *“She knew what I googled.”*

**Threat model:** A friend-turned-aggressor has access to browsing habits, possibly via a compromised router or synced Google account.

**Challenge:** The person notices conversations and ads reflect private searches.

**Roleplay angle:** Map the potential leaks. Assign attackers to plan surveillance routes; defenders to cut them off.

### *“Deepfake at the door.”*

**Threat model:** The target receives a convincing video appearing to show them in a compromising situation.

**Challenge:** It’s fake—but others believe it.

**Roleplay angle:** What are the response options? (Legal, emotional, technical.) Is it better to engage or go dark?

### *“Good malware, bad intentions.”*

**Threat model:** A team is asked to analyse a piece of malware left on a shared machine. It doesn’t cause harm—but 
it *does* track, screenshot, and signal back to a server.

**Challenge:** Should it be reverse-engineered, reported, or preserved as evidence?

**Roleplay angle:** Encourage different reactions: defender, legal advocate, technician, survivor. Debate the consequences.

## Notes for facilitators

* Don’t assume everyone’s coming in with a tech background. Offer cheat sheets or simple explainers alongside.
* If your group is quiet, ask “what would make this situation *worse*?” before pivoting to solutions. People often find it easier to start with worst-case thinking.
* Take breaks. Dark humour helps. Tea helps more.

Roleplay is a safe way to practise unsafe worlds. Survivors are already threat analysts by necessity—these sessions help formalise that knowledge into something shareable, buildable, and powerful.
