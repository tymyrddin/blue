# Workshop feedback form (for survivors, by survivors)

This form is anonymous unless *you* choose to include your name or contact. You can answer as many or as few questions 
as you like. Your input helps shape future workshops to better meet the needs of people navigating life after abuse.

We know it’s a lot to ask for thoughts after heavy material—thank you for whatever you choose to share.

## 1. Looking back on this workshop

* What moments or activities stood out to you (in a good or bad way)?
* Was anything confusing, overwhelming, or not explained clearly?
* Was anything particularly useful, reassuring, or empowering?

### 2. About the content

* Did the topics feel relevant to your experience or situation?
* Was there anything important you *wish* had been included?
* Were there any parts that didn’t feel safe, respectful, or appropriate?

### 3. About the delivery

* How did the facilitator(s) handle questions, emotions, and sensitive material?
* Was the pace OK for you? (Too fast? Too slow? Just right?)
* Did the space—physical or online—feel comfortable and private enough?

### 4. Thinking ahead

* What would you want someone like you to know *before* attending a workshop like this?
* What could make it easier for someone to join or stay involved?
* Would you feel comfortable recommending this workshop to others? Why or why not?

### 5. Anything else you’d like to share?

*(This could be a story, a suggestion, a critique, or even a one-word mood. Entirely up to you.)*

### Optional: If you'd like to be involved in shaping future workshops…
