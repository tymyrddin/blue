# Practical exercises in documenting evidence for law enforcement

In many abuse or stalking cases, the first thing a survivor hears from the police is: *“Do you have any evidence?”*

It’s a painful question, but a crucial one. Collecting digital evidence — calmly, safely, and in a legally useful way 
— can help build a stronger case. These exercises walk through real-world scenarios and how to record what’s 
happening in a way that makes sense to law enforcement.

## Exercise 1: Screenshot like a pro (without alerting the abuser)

Scenario: You’ve received a threatening message on WhatsApp or Instagram.

Goal: Capture a timestamped image that shows *who*, *what*, and *when*.

Steps:

1. Open the message, but do not reply.
2. Take a screenshot of the full conversation. On most phones:

   * Android: Power + Volume Down.
   * iPhone: Side button + Volume Up.
3. Check that:

   * The sender’s name or number is visible.
   * The time and date of the message are visible.
4. Do not crop the image. Keep the original.
5. Save it in a clearly named folder (e.g. “evidence-whatsapp-threats-april”).
6. If possible, email it to yourself *from another email address* as a backup.

*If the message disappears or they delete it, your screenshot still stands.*

## Exercise 2: Record online harassment or impersonation

Scenario: Someone has created a fake social media account pretending to be you.

Goal: Document the impersonation and the date it was active.

Steps:

1. Visit the fake profile using a web browser, not an app. (Easier for capturing links.)
2. Take screenshots of:

   * The full profile page (name, photo, bio).
   * Any posts or messages sent.
3. Copy the URL of the fake account.
4. Paste that URL into a text file with the date and time you saw it.
5. Report the fake account to the platform — *but only after* capturing evidence.

Optional: *Use [archive.today](https://archive.today) to save a snapshot of the page, in case it’s deleted.*

## Exercise 3: Document stalking via location tracking

Scenario: You believe someone is tracking your movements digitally.

Goal: Record patterns, suspected tools, and dates.

Steps:

1. Keep a daily log (paper or digital) for 2–4 weeks, noting:

   * Any suspicious behaviour (e.g. they “just happen” to show up).
   * Any notifications about unfamiliar logins or device access.
   * When your phone battery drains unusually fast.
2. Note dates, times, and locations.
3. If you suspect a specific app or tool (like Life360, Find My iPhone), write it down.
4. Do not uninstall or wipe anything without first talking to a support worker or digital safety expert. It could be key evidence.

Follow-up: *Ask a trusted person or tech support worker to inspect the phone for spyware, but only if it’s safe to do so.*

## Exercise 4: Preserve abusive emails or DMs

Scenario: You're receiving harassing emails, or being spammed via messages.

Goal: Save the original message, headers included.

Steps:

1. In your email, click "Show original" or "View headers" (exact location depends on the service).
2. Save the email as a .eml or .txt file with the full headers intact.
3. If you can’t do that, at minimum:

   * Screenshot the message with the sender’s address and timestamp visible.
   * Note whether the email was forwarded, replied to, or marked as spam.
4. Create a folder just for these and back it up securely.

For DMs (Instagram, Facebook etc.):

* Screenshot before blocking.
* Save the username, message, and timestamp.

## Exercise 5: Create an evidence pack for police

Scenario: You’re preparing to go to the police or ask a solicitor for help.

Goal: Organise your evidence clearly, with minimal tech fuss.

Steps:

1. Create a folder on your computer called “Evidence – \[Your Name or Case Name]”.
2. Inside, make subfolders:

   * “Screenshots”
   * “Email evidence”
   * “Social media”
   * “Phone logs or tracking”
   * “Daily log”
3. For each item, include:

   * A clear filename (e.g. “2025-06-01-threatening-whatsapp.png”).
   * A brief note in a text file: *what it shows*, *when it happened*, and *why it matters*.
4. If you’re handing it to someone (advocate, solicitor, police), provide:

   * A summary list of the contents.
   * Your preferred contact method and a safe time to reach you.

## Final advice

* Do not delete anything until you’ve spoken to a support worker or legal adviser.
* Do not engage or escalate — responding often helps the abuser, not you.
* Back everything up — ideally on a USB stick or cloud service with a strong password.
* Trust your instincts — if something feels off, document it. Even small things build patterns.
