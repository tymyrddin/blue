IPA digital safety guides
===========================

These guides are built for the real world — where someone might be escaping control, harassment, or surveillance, and
needs answers without digging through tech forums.

Each one walks through a specific issue that often comes up in intimate partner abuse (IPA) cases: from securing
communication, freezing credit reports, and adjusting bank privacy settings, to using and spotting GPS spoofing.

Whether you’re a survivor, support worker, or ally, these guides are here to put knowledge back in your hands —
quietly, clearly, and on your terms.
