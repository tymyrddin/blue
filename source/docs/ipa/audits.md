# Hands-on device audits

*A practical guide to checking phones and computers for spyware*  

## Why device audits matter 

When Lisa left her abusive partner, she didn't realise he'd installed tracking software on her tablet that recorded 
every website she visited. Like many survivors, she only discovered the spyware when applying for housing support - 
the shelter's tech volunteer found three hidden tracking apps.  

Device audits help survivors:  

- Regain privacy by finding hidden tracking software  
- Secure evidence for legal cases against abusers  
- Feel confident their communications are truly private  

## What you'll need for basic checks 

1. A clean computer (one the abuser never accessed)  
2. A USB drive (16GB or larger)  
3. Free detection tools (listed below)  
4. Paper and pen to document findings  

*Budget note:* Many women's shelters now have "tech safety kits" with these items pre-prepared.  

## Preparing your tools safely  

On a clean computer: 

1. Download these free tools onto your USB drive:  
   - Malwarebytes (malwarebytes.com) - detects commercial spyware  
   - PiRogue Toolkit (pts-project.org) - finds hidden tracking apps  
   - USB WriteProtector (avoid accidental file changes)  

2. Disconnect from Wi-Fi before inserting the USB into any device being checked  

*Safety note:* Always use public library computers or shelter devices for downloads if your personal devices might 
be compromised.  

## Checking an Android phone  

1. Install Malwarebytes from your USB:  
   - Open "Files" on the phone  
   - Tap the Malwarebytes APK file  
   - Allow installation from "Unknown Sources" (temporarily)  

2. Run a full scan (takes 10-15 minutes)  

3. Check for suspicious apps:  
   - Go to Settings → Apps → Show system apps  
   - Look for anything with "track", "monitor" or random letter names  

4. Review permissions:  
   - Settings → Apps → App permissions  
   - Remove location/microphone access from non-essential apps  

*Real example:* A Manchester shelter found 17 instances of "KidsGuard Pro" disguised as calculator apps last year.  

## Checking an iPhone  

1. Look for device management profiles:  
   - Settings → General → VPN & Device Management  
   - Delete any unfamiliar profiles  

2. Check app permissions:  
   - Settings → Privacy & Security  
   - Review location services, microphone access  

3. Monitor battery usage:  
   - Settings → Battery  
   - Unknown apps draining battery may be spyware  

*Important:* iPhones are harder to infect but not impossible - especially if the abuser had physical access.  

## Checking Windows computers  

1. Run Malwarebytes from your USB:  
   - Don't install it - run the portable version  
   - Quarantine any threats found  

2. Check for keyloggers:  
   - Press Ctrl+Alt+Del → Task Manager  
   - Look for unfamiliar processes using high CPU  

3. Review browser extensions:  
   - Chrome: chrome://extensions  
   - Remove anything suspicious  

*Shelter tip:* In Liverpool, advocates found abusers using "Chrome Remote Desktop" to maintain access after breakups.  

## Documenting findings  

Create a simple log with:  
- Date/time of audit  
- Devices checked  
- Suspicious items found  
- Actions taken  

*Example: "15/3/2025 - Samsung Galaxy A12 - Found 'TrackView' app with location permissions. Uninstalled and reset location settings."*
