Department of Silent Stability
=====================================

   :alt: An empty, dimly lit bureaucratic corridor with unmarked doors, no signage, no windows. A single steampunk desk lamp casts soft blue light onto neatly stacked papers with no readable text. No humans present.

Operating discreetly under the Patrician’s mandate, the Department of Silent Stability advises on, assists with, and
implements defensive strategies across public and private spheres. Its presence is subtle, its influence pervasive,
and its intelligence gathering ensures that Ankh-Morpork continues to function despite chaos, intrigue, or negligence,
without anyone knowing who works there or where they are.
