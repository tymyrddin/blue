# Vulnerability research

Purpose: Safely investigate firmware for security issues.

Sections:

* Static analysis methods

  * Disassembly and inspection of binaries
  * Hardcoded credentials, default settings, protocol misconfigurations
  * Error messages and unusual firmware behaviour

* Lab-only emulation

  * Sandboxed simulation of device firmware
  * Safe experimentation without touching production devices

* Documentation

  * Detailed notes, screenshots, extracted artefacts
  * Unsafe or sensitive items clearly flagged
  * Mapping of vulnerabilities to firmware versions
