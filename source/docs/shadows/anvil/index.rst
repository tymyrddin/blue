The Silent Anvil
=====================================

   :alt: A secretive industrial‑style workshop hidden in a Victorian‑steampunk city, glowing screens and mechanical contraptions everywhere, female engineers in trench coats and goggles examining circuit boards and firmware code, shelves full of PLCs, RTUs, smart home devices, and labelled firmware bins, copper pipes and gears, warm lamplight, shadows suggesting secrecy, digital schematics projected in mid-air, a sense of careful observation and quiet diligence

The Silent Anvil is an initiative combining laboratory research and responsible network detection. At its core, the
project conducts forensic extraction of firmware from industrial control systems, smart home devices, and related
embedded platforms, deriving attribution artefacts such as banners, protocol constants, and web assets. These artefacts
are then used to quietly identify instances of vulnerable deployments in the wild, enabling coordinated, ethical
notification to operators, vendors, and relevant authorities.

The Anvil operates under strict safety protocols: all research is static, non-intrusive, and documented for internal
oversight, ensuring that the Department maintains operational discretion while proactively safeguarding critical
systems and consumer devices.
