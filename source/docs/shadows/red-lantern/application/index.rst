Practical application
======================================================

Time to apply the craft to a specific, insidious threat: a villain not just running through the digital streets, but
secretly moving into the basement. You can hunt for techniques like Registry-based persistence, where a foe
plants a key to let themselves back into the city's very infrastructure. Through rule chaining and proactive
hunting, you can learn to find not just the broken lock, but the master key hidden in the walls, proving you
can outthink Ankh-Morpork's most patient and embedded criminals.
