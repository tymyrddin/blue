Observing Red Lanterns and False Horizons
======================================================

   :alt: Night over steampunk city Ankh-Morpork, viewed from high above; the city sprawls deep below; about 20 glowing red oil lanterns are visible in the city, forming a subtle, intricate irregular network of signals.

In light of recent, tolerably informative irregularities within the city's signalling apparatus, a controlled
expansion of our observational cadre is deemed a prudent, pre-emptive measure. This accelerated induction will focus
not on the scholarly depths of guild taxonomy, but on the immediate, practical craft of watching the current, not
the stone: training probationers in the core recognition of anomalous signal patterns, the swift correlation of
whispers across district lines using our basic warrant-tools, and the cardinal discipline of non-intervention unless
a direct threat to operational continuity is confirmed.

The objective is to amplify our informational yield from the ongoing experimentation without disturbing its useful,
reversible flow, ensuring we have more eyes on the tide without ever needing to reveal we built a dam.
