Subject: Anomalous re-routing events and potential for localised consensus confusion

Recent, high-fidelity observations from our packet-loss analysts indicate a pattern of sophisticated, non-random 
experimentation within city signalling systems. This activity involves irregular routing behaviour, including 
anomalous re-routing events, signal path announcements of questionable provenance, and priority indicators that 
deviate from established protocols.

While these events have not yet precipitated a service-level disruption, their pattern and precision suggest 
deliberate exploration of systemic soft points. The primary risk is assessed not as immediate failure, but as the 
potential to seed localised consensus confusion among dependent subsystems, thereby degrading overall network 
coherence.

Staff are instructed to:

- Increase monitoring of convergence times and scrutinise underlying trust assumptions in affected sectors.
- Correlate these signalling anomalies across all guild and subsystem boundaries to map the full scope of exploration.
- Avoid visible intervention. Our priority is observation. Active countermeasures are authorised only upon direct threat to operational continuity.

The activity is currently assessed as informationally valuable and operationally tolerable, provided it remains reversible, non-destructive, and crucially, unpublicised.

Should the actors behind this exploration attempt to transition from observation to persistence, coercion, or reputation damage, full escalation protocols will be activated.

No further action is required at this time.
