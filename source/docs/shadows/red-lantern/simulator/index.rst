The Unreal Embassy Simulator
======================================================

Welcome to the Unreal Embassy, a controlled pocket dimension where the Patrician sanctions wholesale digital mayhem
for the good of the city. Here, theory meets the cobbles. This is your live-fire training ground, a safe,
consequence-free simulator where you deploy your crafted rules and correlation logic against a fully orchestrated
MITRE ATT&CK invasion.

You can witness your alerts fire in real-time as simulated thieves, assassins, and corrupt clerks execute multi-stage
campaigns, allowing you to validate your detection, fine-tune your thresholds, and learn the visceral rhythm of a
true incident without risking a single real barrel of dwarf bread.
