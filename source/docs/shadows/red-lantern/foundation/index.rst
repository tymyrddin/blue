Before patrolling the digital streets, earn the city's twisted geography and the motives of its villains.
These pages describe a map and criminal taxonomy: mastering the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand guild methods,
learning Detection-as-Code to write reliable watch procedures, and studying Sigma rules to translate suspicious
whispers from every district—be it a log from the Seamstresses' Guild or an alert from the Assassins' ledger,
into a common tongue for the Watch.
