===================================

Virtual network computing, or VNC, is a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to allow for controlling a server remotely. A VNC server transfers keyboard and mouse events, and displays the remote hostâ€™s screen via a network connection (relaying the graphical screen updates back). Servers are best set up as minimal environment, and installing GUI might lead to high hardware utilization. Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing system  to remotely control another computer.

VNC is not an encrypted protocol and can be subject to packet sniffing. Sessions can be secured:
* TightVNC is lightweight and connections will be smooth and stable even on slower internet connections. SSH tunnelling can be used.
* TigerVNC supports security schemes such as X509 that combines standard VNC authentication with GNUTLS encryption and server identification. <=
