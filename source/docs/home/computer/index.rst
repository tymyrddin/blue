Computer security: Keeping the digital kitchen knives out of reach
======================================================================================================

Lock this chaos down by stripping admin rights (because nobody needs nuclear codes to check email), automating
updates like you’re running a robot daycare, scanning every sketchy download like it’s a suspicious alleyway USB drive,
playing Task Manager bouncer to evict CPU-hogging malware party crashers, and wrapping sensitive files in encryption
tighter than your weird uncle’s conspiracy theory foil hat. Because in 2025, the internet isn’t just watching—it’s
taking notes, and your bank login shouldn’t be its favorite notebook.
