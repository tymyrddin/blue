Emergency compromise response: The digital fire extinguisher
======================================================================================================

Your device(s) is/are on fire? Stop the digital arsonist by yanking the Wi-Fi plug like you’re unplugging a possessed
toaster, then burn all bridges—reset every password starting with email (the master key to your digital life), and if
things look grim, nuke it from orbit by restoring from a clean backup (because malware loves a good comeback tour).
Remember: Panic is optional, but acting like a caffeinated secret agent is mandatory—your data is counting on you.
