# Update everything (Because your phone is not a vintage collectible)

Why? Hackers exploit known flaws—like using last year’s security patch as a welcome mat.

## How-to?

* Android: Settings → System → System Update (Check monthly).
* iPhone: Settings → General → Software Update (Enable automatic updates).
* Apps: Enable auto-updates in Google Play/App Store.

Tip: If your phone no longer gets updates, time for a new one (your banking app agrees).
