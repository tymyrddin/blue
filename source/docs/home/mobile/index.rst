Mobile security: childproofing the digital junk drawer
======================================================================================================

Your smartphone is like a toddler's junk drawer: crammed with half-dead apps, questionable permissions, and enough
personal data to make a hacker squeal with glee." In 2025, where AI-powered attacks rifle through outdated apps
like a kid rummaging for candy and "zero-click" exploits can hijack your device faster than you can say "why does
Flappy Bird need my contacts?", locking down your mobile mess isn't just smart, it's survival. Disable shady app
installs (unless you enjoy surprise malware loot boxes), update religiously like you're feeding a tamagotchi,
revoke permissions from apps that treat your microphone like their personal confessional, and slap a VPN on public
WiFi like you're wrapping it in digital bubble wrap.
