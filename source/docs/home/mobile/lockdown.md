# Android’s "No Stranger Danger" mode

Why? Sideloading APKs is like accepting candy from a van with "FREE APPS" painted on the side.

## How-to?

* Android: Settings → Security → Install unknown apps → Disable for all apps
* iPhone: Already blocked (thanks, Apple’s walled garden).

Exception: Only enable for FDroid (if you’re a FOSS nerd).
