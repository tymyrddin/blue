# Audit app permissions (The "Why Does Solitaire Need My Contacts?" check)

Why? Apps are nosy. A flashlight shouldn’t need your location 24/7.

## How-to?

* Android: Settings → Apps → "App Name" → Permissions → Revoke unnecessary ones.
* iPhone: Settings → Privacy & Security → Check each permission category.

## Red flags

* Weather apps requesting SMS access.
* Games using microphone/camera.
* "Free" VPNs with 100 trackers.

Nuclear Option: Use Shelter (Android) to sandbox shady apps.
