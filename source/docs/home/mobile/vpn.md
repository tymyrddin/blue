# VPN on Public Wi-Fi (Because "Free Airport WiFi" = Hacker Happy Hour)

Why? Public networks are like shouting your passwords in a coffee shop.

## Good options

* ProtonVPN (Free tier available, and very trustworthy)
* Mullvad (No logs, pay with cash if you’re extra)
* IVPN (Transparent & audited)

## How-to?

* Install app → Create account.
* Always turn on before joining public Wi-Fi.
* Bonus: Use Always-on VPN (Android: Settings → Network & Internet → VPN → Gear icon).

Avoid: "Free" VPNs, they’re just data mills.
