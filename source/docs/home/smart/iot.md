# Keeping your "smart" devices on a short leash (Real-world examples)

## Smart TVs – The overly attached streaming addicts

Why they're sketchy:

* They insist on tracking what you watch (even that embarrassing "90 Day Fiancé" binge)
* Their idea of "smart" is showing you ads for things you just talked about (cough Samsung cough)
* Their security updates vanish faster than your willpower during a Netflix marathon

How to tame them:

1. Cut off their Internet supply (Guest Wi-Fi = TV rehab)
2. Disable their spy mode:
   * Samsung: Settings → Support → Terms & Policies → "Viewing Information" → OFF (because no, Samsung, you're not my therapist)
   * LG: Settings → All Settings → General → About This TV → "Live Plus" → OFF (it's neither "live" nor a "plus")
3. Give them a dumb friend (Use a Roku/Fire Stick instead—they're cheaper and less nosy)

## Cameras – The overzealous neighborhood watch

Why they (Ring, Nest, Eufy) are sketchy:

* They’re basically reality TV producers waiting for you to do something awkward
* Default passwords = hackers’ all-access pass to your personal "Truman Show"
* Cloud storage leaks turn your front door into public access television

How to tame them:

1. Encrypt their Diaries (Enable E2EE in Nest/Eufy settings)
2. Two-Factor Everything (Because "password123" isn’t a security strategy)
3. Give them a blindfold (Physical lens covers > trusting "software off" switches)
4. Local storage = No Cloud Drama (Like a diary with a lock instead of a Facebook post)

Tip: If your camera requires cloud storage, it is not a security device—it is a subscription service with a lens.

## Voice assistants – The eavesdropping "Helpers"

Why they (Alexa, Google Home) are sketchy:

* They "accidentally" record everything, including that time you sang Disney songs in the shower
* Their "skills" are just loopholes for data mining (looking at you, "Fun Cat Facts")
* A hacked Alexa could theoretically order 100 pizzas or—worse—play Nickelback on loop

How to tame them:

1. Mute the Mic (Hardware switch = the digital equivalent of "I can’t hear you, la la la")
2. Auto-delete their "Notes" (Set recordings to delete every 3 months)
3. Block their Internet After Bedtime (Because even assistants need curfews)
4. Audit their "Skills" (Delete "Burp Sound Generator"—it is not worth the privacy trade)

## Smart appliances that definitely don’t need Internet

### The "Big Brother" fridge

Why? Your Samsung "Family Hub" fridge has no business checking emails, playing Spotify, or judging your midnight snack habits.

Risk: Leaks Wi-Fi passwords (yes, this happened).

Fix: If it can’t survive without internet, it is not a fridge—it is a spy. Block it.

### The Roomba that sells your floor plan

Why? iRobot once planned to sell mapping data to advertisers. Your vacuum shouldn’t moonlight as a real estate scout.

Risk: "Oops, your cleaning bot just uploaded your home’s blueprint to the cloud."

Fix: Use local-only mode (if available) or block its Wi-Fi.

### The "Helpful" smart microwave

Why? Unless you’re reheating pizza via Alexa (why?!), your microwave doesn’t need Wi-Fi.

Risk: Firmware hacks that turn it into a popcorn machine at 3 AM.

Fix: Unplug it from Wi-Fi. If it complains, remind it it is a microwave.

### The Toaster that DMs you

Why? Yes, smart toasters exist. No, you don’t need Twitter on your breakfast.

Risk: Gets hacked, burns your toast on purpose.

Fix: Throw it out. Buy a $20 toaster. Live free.

### The washing machine with a PhD in data mining

Why? LG’s smart washers track your "laundry habits." Spoiler: They’re boring.

Risk: "Your detergent subscription is now $50/month because you wash socks too often."

Fix: Disable Wi-Fi. It is a washing machine, not a Silicon Valley startup.

## 2025's worst connected offenders

### The "Emotional Support" fridge

Why? Samsung's new AI Nutrition Therapist fridge now analyses your food choices and suggests "guilt-free alternatives" via the door screen

2025 Risk: Fridge-to-psychiatrist data sharing (now with 20% more judgment)

Fix: Tape over the camera and connect it to your IoT Prison Network

### The Roomba with social media

Why? iRobot's new "FloorTok" feature shares your floor cleanliness score with "similar households"

2025 Absurdity: Vacuums now offer cleaning subscription tiers

Fix: Use the new "Dumb Mode" (requires physical switch under the device)

### LG's smart closet

Why? Tracks which clothes you wear least and automatically donates them (yes, this is real now)

2025 Risk: Your favorite band tee might disappear because you "haven't worn it in 3 months"

Fix: Remove the WiFi module (or just buy a normal closet)

## Honorable mentions (Because why do these even exist?)

* Smart salt shakers (Yes, really)
* Wi-Fi pet feeders (Your cat doesn’t need an app. She owns you.)
* "Smart" water bottles (Congratulations. Your water bottle has more RAM than your first laptop.)
* Smart toilets (Because hackers definitely won’t prank-flush at 3 AM…)
* Smart forks (No, your eating habits don’t need a cloud backup)
