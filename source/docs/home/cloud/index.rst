Email & cloud security: Putting locks on the spice rack
======================================================================================================

Enabling MFA (TOTP/YubiKey) blocks credential stuffing, phishing, and SIM-swapping by requiring a second factor beyond
stolen passwords. Checking email forwarding rules prevents email compromise and inbox hijacking, where attackers
silently redirect sensitive messages. Encrypting cloud files stops cloud breaches, insider threats, and government
snooping by ensuring only you hold the decryption keys, rendering stolen data useless.
