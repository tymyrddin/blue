# Change default password (All router brands)

Why? Default logins are public knowledge (e.g., "admin:password" for Netgear, "admin:admin" for Linksys).

1. Find your routerâ€™s IP:
   * Windows: Open Command Prompt > type ipconfig > look for "Default Gateway."
   * Mac: System Settings > Wi-Fi > click your network > see "Router."
2. Type this IP into a browser. Use current credentials (often on router sticker).
3. Navigate to:
   * TP-Link: System Tools > Password
   * ASUS: Administration > System
   * Google Nest Wi-Fi: Home app > Wi-Fi > Settings gear > Advanced Networking

Set a 12+ character password like `PurpleChewingGiraffe$42!`. Write it on paper and store in a safe.
