The silent pickpocket in your pocket
====================================================

our phone is a treasure trove of personal data—bank logins, private messages, and those very specific search
histories—yet we treat its security like an afterthought, assuming hackers are too busy with PCs to care.
But mobile malware is the digital equivalent of a pickpocket who’s realized it’s easier to steal your wallet when
you’re constantly holding it, and with attacks evolving from fake apps to IoT device hijinks, your smartphone is
now the weakest link in your digital life. Hackers have shifted tactics, and if you’re still relying on
"Eh, it’s just a phone" as a security strategy, you might as well hand them your passwords with a bow on top.
