# Drive-By downloads: The Internet's sSneakiest pickpockets

Picture this: you're browsing your favorite news site, sipping coffee, when—bam!—your device gets infected without you even clicking a thing. That’s the magic (or horror) of drive-by downloads, where malware hitches a ride on legitimate websites like a digital stowaway. Whether it’s a hacked ad network, a compromised plugin, or a sneaky script hiding in plain sight, these attacks turn innocent browsing into a silent heist. No consent needed—just a vulnerable browser and a sprinkle of hacker ingenuity.

The two flavours of digital food poisoning

1. "Authorized" Downloads (The Bait-and-Switch): You think you’re downloading a legit program (or ignoring a "special offer" checkbox), but surprise! You just volunteered for a malware side hustle. Classic moves include:

* Bundling spyware with free software ("Download this PDF converter! Terms and conditions may include ransomware.").
* Redirecting you to a fake update page ("Your Flash Player is totally out of date—promise!").

2. Unauthorized Downloads (The Silent Ninja): No clicks required! Hackers exploit flaws in websites (or your browser) to force-feed malware to your device. One visit to a compromised site, and—poof—you’re now part of a botnet. Bonus points if the site was your dentist’s homepage.

## The Aftermath: From annoying to apocalyptic

* PUPs/PUAs: The "legal" malware—adware, toolbars, and other digital junk that turns your device into a billboard.
* Full-scale hijacks: Spyware, ransomware, or remote access trojans (RATs) that steal data, lock files, or turn your webcam into a reality TV show.
