# Identity theft on autopilot

Imagine if pickpockets could outsource their work—no sticky fingers required, just a malware subscription and a dream. That’s Infostealer-as-a-Service (IaaS), the cybercriminal’s answer to passive income. For a modest fee, even the most incompetent hacker can rent a digital vacuum cleaner that sucks up everything from bank logins to crypto wallets, all while sipping a latte and letting the malware do the heavy lifting.

## How your data gets mugged

* "Please Enable Macros" – The Classic Con: A seemingly innocent Word doc arrives, perhaps titled "URGENT INVOICE_2023_FINAL_FINAL.docx." Enable macros, and voilà—your passwords are now on sale in a Telegram channel.
* Fake But Fabulous – The Impersonation Game: Hackers clone trusted sites (Adobe, Dropbox, even your bank), buy Google/Facebook ads to promote them, and watch as victims voluntarily download malware, thinking it’s a legit update. Nothing builds trust like a sponsored search result!
* App Store Squatters – The Wolf in Sheep’s Code: By sneaking corrupted apps into stores (looking at you, "Free PDF Converter Premium"), attackers turn official marketplaces into malware vending machines.

## The shopping list: what’s in the digital duffle bag?

IaaS doesn’t discriminate—it’ll steal your online banking creds, Netflix password, selfies, and even that Bitcoin wallet you forgot about. The data gets neatly packaged and sold to:

* Fraudsters (for draining accounts)
* Phishers (for more targeted scams)
* Blackmailers (for "Remember these embarrassing DMs?" leverage)

## Why healthcare & finance?

Simple: High-value data, low patience for downtime. A stolen hospital login can sell for 10x a regular email—because nothing says "pay up" like holding patient records hostage.
Fighting Back: The Cat-and-Mouse Game

## Defenders are stuck playing whack-a-mole with:

* Advanced EDR (to catch fileless malware)
* User training ("No, Dave, ‘Password123’ won’t cut it")
* Ad-blockers for malware (Blacklisting malicious domains after they trend)
