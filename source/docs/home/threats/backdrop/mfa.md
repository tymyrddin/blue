# When "Extra Security" becomes just another hurdle for hackers to vault over

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) was supposed to be the digital bouncer keeping the riff-raff out, until attackers realised they could just tire the bouncer out, trick him, or steal his clipboard. Now, MFA bypass techniques are evolving faster than users can say, "Wait, wasn’t this supposed to stop breaches?"
 
1. MFA Fatigue-The Annoyance Hack: Attackers bombard users with endless push notifications ("Is this you logging in? How about now? Now? NOW?") until sheer exhaustion or muscle memory kicks in, and click, the gates swing open. It’s like a telemarketer calling 100 times until you finally answer just to make it stop. Lesson: If your MFA prompts feel like spam, they might be spam.
2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)-The Digital Doppelgänger: Why steal credentials when you can trick users into handing them over on a silver platter? Modern phishing proxies intercept MFA tokens in real-time, letting attackers waltz right in. The user sees a legit login page; the hacker gets a VIP pass to their account. Bonus points for OTP bots that automate the whole scam, because even criminals hate manual labor.
3. Token Theft-The "Trust Me, I’m You" Gambit: Session cookies, meant to save you from constant logins, are now a hacker’s golden ticket. Steal the cookie, and voilà: the system thinks you’re the rightful owner. It’s like photocopying someone’s ID and using it to empty their bank account while they nap.
The Future: Will MFA Need an MFA?

If hackers keep outsmarting "something you know" (passwords), "something you have" (phones), and "something you are" (biometrics), what’s next? "Something you remember" (childhood trauma as a security question)? "Something you imagine" (brainwave authentication)? The more we externalise our identities into the digital void, the weirder, and riskier, security gets.
