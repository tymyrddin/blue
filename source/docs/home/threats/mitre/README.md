# The Attackers’ menu (MITRE ATT&CK mapping)

Hackers follow patterns. MITRE ATT&CK breaks these into tactics and techniques—like a burglar’s step-by-step guide to 
raiding your digital pantry. Here’s what matters most @Home in 2025:

## Priority #1: Initial access (How they get in)

* Phishing (T1566) – Fake emails/texts ("Your Netflix account is expired! Click here!").
* Exploit Public-Facing Apps (T1190) – Your router’s admin page, that old NAS box, or your smart toothbrush’s unpatched API.
* Supply Chain Compromise (T1195) – That "free" app you downloaded? Congrats, it’s malware.

Fix:

* Enable MFA everywhere (even if it’s annoying and reportedly hackable).
* Update everything (yes, even the creepy smart mirror).
* Stop clicking "urgent" links (unless you enjoy ransomware).

## Priority #2: Execution (What they do once inside)

* Command-Line Interface (T1059) – Hackers love abusing curl/PowerShell to download malware.
* Malicious Scripts (T1059.003) – That "cute" screensaver from a forum? Oops, it’s a keylogger.

Fix:

* Restrict admin rights (your kid doesn’t need sudo access).
* Use an ad-blocker (to stop "malvertising" drive-by downloads).

## Priority #3: Persistence (How they stay inside)

* Scheduled Tasks (T1053) – Malware that wakes up every Tuesday to steal your banking info.
* Browser Extensions (T1176) – That "free PDF converter" you installed? It’s reading your Gmail.

Fix:

* Audit browser extensions (delete anything sketchy).
* Check running processes (Task Manager is your friend).

## Priority #4: Exfiltration (How they steal your data)

* Cloud Storage (T1537) – Hackers love auto-syncing your "Documents" folder to their server.
* Email Forwarding Rules (T1114) – Ever found weird rules in your Gmail? That’s how they spy.

Fix:

* Encrypt sensitive files (even if it’s just cat pics).
* Check email filters (hackers love hiding their tracks).

## The "Gap Analysis" (Where You’re Screwed)

Compare your current setup to MITRE’s attack list. The gaps are your To-Do list.

Example Gaps (and How to Fix Them)

| Gap	| How to Fix (2025 Edition) |
|-------|---------------------------|
| No MFA on router	| Enable it. Now. Or rename your Wi-Fi "HackMePlease." |
| Outdated smart TV	| Throw it out. Or disconnect it. Your choice. |
| All family devices share one admin account	| Stop. Just stop. |

## The "2025 threat forecast" (What’s coming?)

* AI-Powered Phishing (T1566.002) – Scams so personalized, they’ll know your dog’s name.
* Ransomware for Smart Homes (T1486) – Hackers locking your thermostat until you pay.
* 5G IoT Botnets (T1583.002) – Your fridge DDoSing a bank for fun.

### Future-proofing

* Segment your network (IoT devices on a guest Wi-Fi).
* Assume everything is hostile (because it probably is).

## Final verdict: What to focus on in 2025?

    MFA Everywhere (or get hacked).

    Update All the Things (yes, even the "dumb" coffee maker).

    Assume Phishing Will Get You (train your family like they’re corporate employees).

    Isolate IoT Devices (unless you want your Roomba spying on you).
