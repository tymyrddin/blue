When your living room becomes a cyber battleground
==============================================================================

Your home network used to be a quiet digital cul-de-sac—now it’s Grand Central Station for every malware strain,
phishing scam, and IoT exploit imaginable. Between government-mandated apps built like house of cards, family devices
swapping more germs than a kindergarten flu season, and tech companies treating security as an optional premium feature,
we’ve all become unwilling participants in the world’s largest penetration test. The attack surface isn’t just growing;
it’s mutating faster than a virus in a petri dish of neglected software updates.

This is where we fight back—by treating our routers like castle gates and our smart devices like potential Trojan
horses. Using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, we can stop playing whack-a-mole with threats and start strategically
reinforcing our digital drawbridges. Because in today’s world, “home network security” isn’t paranoia—it’s just what
responsible adults do between unplugging the kids’ infected tablet and explaining to Grandma why her “perfectly good”
Windows 7 machine can’t go online anymore.
