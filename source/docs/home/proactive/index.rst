Proactive measures: stocking the digital first-aid kit
======================================================================================================

Think of cybersecurity like keeping a well-stocked medicine cabinet—you don't wait until you're ill to buy paracetamol.
Regular backups are your antiseptic wipes (because losing family photos to ransomware stings worse than a paper cut),
while a password manager acts like those childproof caps—annoying but necessary when you've got digital toddlers
(read: hackers) rummaging through your cabinets. Throw in some auto-updates (the equivalent of taking your vitamins)
and you've got a decent chance of surviving the modern internet's version of norovirus season. Just remember—prevention
might be boring, but it beats trying to explain to your bank why your password was "password123".
