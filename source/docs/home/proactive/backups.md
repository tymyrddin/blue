# Backups: Your digital lifeboat (Ransomware can't swim)

Your files are like sandcastles—one bad wave (ransomware, hardware failure, coffee spills) and poof, they’re gone. 
Offline backups are the ultimate "nope" to hackers holding your data hostage. Here’s how to build a backup bunker 
so simple even your grandma would approve.

## Why offline backups win in 2025

* Ransomware-proof: Hackers can’t encrypt what they can’t touch (like that hard drive chilling in your sock drawer).
* No subscription fees: Unlike cloud services, your $60 external drive won’t bill you monthly for the privilege of existing.
* Instant recovery: No waiting for downloads when your laptop takes a swim—just plug and rescue.

## How to build a backup bunker

1. Buy a hard drive (Not a fancy one)
   * Get a WD My Passport or Seagate Backup Plus (2TB+ for most humans).
   * Avoid "smart" drives with apps/cloud crap—just a dumb metal box with a USB port.
2. Copy your life onto it
   * Plug it into your computer.
   * Open File Explorer (Win) or Finder (Mac).
   * Drag-and-drop: Photos (unless you want to lose baby pics); Documents (tax returns, resumes, that novel you’ll finish someday); Passwords (export from Bitwarden/1Password)
   * Eject properly (right-click → "Eject" on Windows, drag to Trash on Mac).
3. Store it like a squirrel’s nut
   * Unplug it when done. Always.
   * Hide it somewhere boring (drawer, fireproof safe, under the cat bed).
   * Bonus: Make two drives, keep one offsite (work/trusted friend’s house).

## Tips for backup nerds

* Schedule manual backups (first of every month = "Backup Day").
* Encrypt sensitive files (Veracrypt for folders, BitLocker/FileVault for full drives).
* Test restores yearly—backups are useless if they’re corrupted.

## Why this matters more than ever

* Ransomware gangs now target backups first (they hate this one trick!).
* AI-powered attacks can wipe cloud sync services in seconds.
* Your phone/laptop will die eventually—often at the worst possible time.

## Tips for maximum survival

* Store drives in a fireproof safe (e.g., SentrySafe).
* Keep one copy offsite (work, friend’s house, safe deposit box).
* Test restores yearly—even "indestructible" drives can fail silently.

## TL;DR on researching drives

* Normal people? WD My Passport.
* Adventure mode? Samsung T7 Shield.
* Prepping for Armageddon? iStorage + M-Disc combo.
