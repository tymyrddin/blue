# Password managers: Your digital vault for all those keys you keep losing

Because your brain is for remembering birthdays, not 87 different variations of "Fluffy123!". A password manager is 
like that ultra-organised friend who actually knows where they left their keys.

## What it fixes

* No more recycling passwords (we see you using "Summer2024" everywhere)
* No more frantic "forgot password?" clicks
* No more sticky notes with your bank login stuck to the monitor

## How it works

* One master password (make it strong - like "correct-horse-battery-staple" strong)
* It generates and remembers random passwords for every site
* Auto-fills logins so you don't have to type (or remember) anything

## Bonus superpowers

* Alerts you when passwords are weak/reused/breached
* Securely shares logins with family (no more texting passwords)
* Works across all your devices (because your phone deserves security too)
