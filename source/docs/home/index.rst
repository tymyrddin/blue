Welcome to Blue Team @Home—where we’re the unpaid security guards of our own digital dumpster fire. Our mission?
To sort through the commercial tech porridge (now with extra raisins of questionable security) and figure out what
won’t get us hacked before breakfast.

The threat landscape moves faster than a toddler with your unlocked phone—governments, schools, and every app under
the sun are herding us online, whether we’re ready or not. Between family-shared devices (aka "malware time-share
condos") and apps built with the security of a wet paper towel, our home networks are basically public parks for
cybercriminals. And let’s not forget the digital divide—where "secure tech" is a luxury some can’t afford, and
"strong password" means "whatever I can remember."

So grab your DIY security toolkit (duct tape, caffeine, and a healthy distrust of "free" apps). We’re not just
users anymore—we’re the accidental sysadmins of our living rooms, trying to build a moat when the castle came
with a welcome mat. Let’s get scrubbing.
