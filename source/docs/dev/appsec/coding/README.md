# Secure coding guidelines

Secure coding prevents vulnerabilities by enforcing strict controls on data handling, authentication, and system interactions. Follow these principles:

* defence in Depth – Multiple layers of security (input validation, output encoding, least privilege).
* Zero Trust – Treat all inputs as malicious, even from "trusted" sources.
* Automate Security – Use linters, SAST tools, and dependency scanners.
