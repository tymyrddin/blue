Security testing for development
===================================================================

Welcome to the world of security testing, where we pretend we're hackersâ€”except we get paid to break things instead of
arrested for it. Your code might look secure, but so did that $5 bike lock until someone sneezed on it.

Why Bother? Because nothing ruins your day like explaining why your "secure" login form just spit out the entire
user database.
