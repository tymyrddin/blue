# TLS/SSL hardening

Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor SSL are cryptographic protocols that secure communications over 
networks. While TLS is widely adopted, misconfigurations and outdated practices can lead to vulnerabilities like 
downgrade attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) exploits, and weak cipher compromises. This guide outlines hardened 
TLS/SSL practices to protect data in transit.
