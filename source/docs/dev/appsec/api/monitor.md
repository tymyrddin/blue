# Real-time monitoring & anomaly detection

Critical Actions:

* Track abnormal request patterns (sudden spikes, unusual endpoints)
* Log all API traffic with full request/response details
* Set up alerts for failed auth attempts, data exfiltration (unusually large responses), suspicious IPs/TOR exit nodes

Example Tools:

* AWS API Gateway + CloudWatch
* Elastic Stack (ELK) for log analysis
* Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
