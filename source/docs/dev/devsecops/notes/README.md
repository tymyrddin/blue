# Notes from the security trenches: A SysEngineer’s ongoing journey

Welcome to my ever-growing collection of security notes. Where theory meets panic, best practices collide with 
real-world chaos, and half the battle is remembering which cloud console I’m logged into. These pages are a mix of 
guided learning (courtesy of TryHackMe’s tough love) and hard-earned lessons from configuring things that should work 
but rarely do on the first try (or second, or third,... Consider this part documentation, part therapy session.

The topics here span from SSDLC methodologies (because "we’ll add security later" is a lie) to securing obscure 
services you didn’t even know existed until they showed up in a compliance audit. There’s threat modelling (aka 
"imagining how Dave might break everything"), security automation (so robots can share our pain), and identity 
management (where "least privilege" fights a losing battle against "but I need admin").

This is a living document. Some sections are polished; others are just placeholders for future frustration, waiting 
for the day I inevitably misconfigure a WAF or accidentally expose a database to the entire internet. Proceed with 
caution, double-check my work, and for the love of all things holy, don’t treat these notes as your only line of 
defence.
