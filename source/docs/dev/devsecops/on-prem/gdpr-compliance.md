- ISO 27001: Certifies ISMS for data centers in Germany (Nuremberg, Falkenstein) and Finland.  
- SCCs for Non-EU Locations: Covers US (Virginia, Oregon) and Singapore data centers.  

## Data residency & control

- Limits non-EU data transfers to cloud server content only; account data remains in the EU.  

## Breach notification & tools

- Log Retention: Apache logs configurable by customers; default backups stored for 14 days.

## Data location

- EU-Centric: Most Hetzner servers and cloud services are hosted in Germany (Falkenstein, Nuremberg) or Finland, with optional U.S./Singapore locations (opt-in required).  
- Object Storage: S3-compatible storage defaults to EU data centers.
