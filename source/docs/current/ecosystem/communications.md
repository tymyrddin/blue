# Communication and coordination

CNA work is as much about collaboration as it is about analysis. Clear, structured communication ensures 
vulnerabilities are handled responsibly and mitigations are applied effectively.

## Vendor communication

Establish professional channels:

* Use official email, ticketing systems, or secure portals.
* Avoid informal messaging that cannot be audited.

Report vulnerabilities responsibly:

* Provide clear, concise descriptions of the issue.
* Include PoC details only within controlled communication.
* Recommend mitigations if appropriate, but never expose exploits publicly.

Track interactions:

  * Log all communications in the internal system.
  * Note dates, recipients, and summary of content for traceability.

## Coordination with CERTs and authorities

Identify the correct CERT:

* National or regional teams for the affected systems.
* Use official submission channels and forms.

Submit structured reports:

* Include impact assessment, affected components, and references.
* Maintain the chain of evidence and ensure records are reproducible.

Follow escalation procedures:

* Notify internal supervisors before escalating externally.
* Respect deadlines and reporting obligations under EU NIS2 or local regulations.

## Public reporting and disclosure-safe summaries

Abstract lessons safely:

* Summarise vulnerabilities without publishing actionable exploits.
* Highlight mitigations, trends, or patterns for awareness and education.

Maintain traceable records:

* Link summaries to internal CVE records and communications.
* Ensure any public-facing content is reviewed and cleared internally.
