# CNA process and governance

CNA work is binding into an international trust system: the CVE programme. Accuracy, compliance, and 
disciplined process are non-negotiable. What to do and how to do it.

## CVE programme rules

Assign CVE IDs:

1. Confirm the vulnerability falls within the CNA scope.
2. Check that it meets CVE inclusion criteria (publicly visible, distinct, and not already catalogued).
3. Allocate a CVE ID following CVE numbering rules.

Publish CVE records:

1. Draft a complete CVE record including description, references, and any mitigation information.
2. Submit through the CVE CNA portal according to programme timelines.

Maintain consistency and compliance:

* Always follow the CNA rules to ensure each CVE is handled the same way.
* Double-check assignments for duplicates or misclassification.

## Responsible disclosure norms

EU NIS2 Directive obligations:

* Track regulatory requirements for operators and vendors.
* Report security incidents according to mandatory timelines.

[ENISA Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/vulnerability-disclosure):

* Disclose vulnerabilities to vendors first.
* Avoid posting exploit details publicly before fixes are available.

Standards:

* Use [ISO/IEC 29147](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) for vulnerability disclosure workflows.
* Use [ISO/IEC 30111](https://www.iso.org/standard/86013.html) for vulnerability handling and triage procedures.

## Internal CNA procedures

Follow templates and workflows:

* Track reports and PoCs in the internal system (GitLab, GitHub).
* Use structured fields for vulnerability details, impact assessment, and mitigation steps.

Coordinate internally:

* Assign tasks to colleagues when validation or cross-checking is needed.
* Keep a consistent naming and numbering scheme across all records.

Refine and audit processes:

* Review past CVEs to spot gaps or inconsistencies.
* Update templates and workflows to improve speed, accuracy, and resilience.
