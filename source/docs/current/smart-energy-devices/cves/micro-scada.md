# Inferred PoC validation paths for CVE-2025-39203

Inferred, defensive validation paths that a CNA administrator most likely follows when validating 
CVE-2025-39203, affecting Hitachi Energy MicroSCADA X SYS600 IEC 61850-8. The descriptions are reverse-engineered 
from advisories and an evenso speculative lab setup. Nothing here claims to be a verbatim log; each step is 
phrased as what is most likely done, observed or recorded. The focus is on deterministic observation, evidence 
collection and mitigation verification without providing (inferred) exploit code.

## Environment and prerequisites (most likely present)

* [Lab setup](../lab.md).
* Isolation: a dedicated VLAN and managed switch with SPAN mirroring are configured to avoid producing side effects on production networks.
* Hardware likely present: the Hitachi Energy MicroSCADA X SYS600 device (matching version/revision), lab PC for analysis, Raspberry Pi for stubs, serial/TTL adapter, surge-protected power supply.
* Software examples installed in analysis VM: `wireshark`, `tcpdump`, `nmap`, `curl`, `openssl`, `binwalk`, `ghidra`/`gdb`, `qemu`/`firmadyne`, and minimal HTTP/IEC 61850 server stubs.
* Private evidence repository with naming and access controls is created to manage artefacts.

## Preparatory actions (most likely taken)

1. VLAN and SPAN setup: VLAN dedicated to this test is configured; the port connected to the SYS600 device is mirrored to the capture interface. Verification via `ping` and `tcpdump -c 100` is performed.

2. Power and serial connectivity: Serial console (if exposed) is attached; boot logs are recorded. The device is powered from a switched, surge-protected strip.

3. IEC 61850 emulation or stub services on SBC: Raspberry Pi likely runs stub IEC 61850 server or minimal MMS services to simulate communications. DNS or network redirection may be employed if the device tries to reach vendor servers.

## Baseline data collection (what is likely captured)

* Firmware hash: the firmware for SYS600 is hashed (e.g. `sha256sum microSCADA_SYS600_x.y.z.bin`) and recorded.
* Passive capture: `tcpdump` on SPAN during boot and idle operation is saved as baseline pcap.
* Serial capture: boot console output is logged.
* Service discovery: `nmap -sS -sV` used to enumerate open IEC 61850 / MMS ports, and HTTP endpoints if present.
* Protocol header inspection: initial IEC 61850 association/auth messages are captured; metadata like sequence numbers, timestamps, and security (TLS or none) are noted.

These baseline artefacts are stored under `/evidence/<labid>/baseline/`.

## Firmware extraction and static analysis (inferred activities)

* Binwalk or similar unpacking of firmware image to access binaries related to IEC 61850-8, MMS server for SYS600.
* Search for keywords (`association`, `mms`, `iec61850`, `tls`, `cert`, `auth`, `timestamp`) to identify relevant modules.
* Selected binaries opened in Ghidra for light annotation: specifically look at association request parsing, timestamp handling, and message forwarding logic. Deep reversing deferred unless needed to understand unexpected crash behaviour.

Decision point: where timestamp validation or sequence checks are visible, validation emphasises input with bad/future timestamps to test the vulnerability; otherwise focus shifts to association/auth patterns.

## Targeted reconnaissance and minimal reproducibility (inferred tests)

Testing is incremental and captured comprehensively. Each reproduction attempt uses strict stop conditions.

### Authentication, association, and timestamp validation

Observation of IEC 61850 association/auth flows, examining whether security is required or if anonymous associations are possible. Raw request/response pairs are collected.

Tests with modified timestamp values in association or forwarding frames (if spec allows) to see if the device rejects or malfunctions. Responses and error codes are recorded.

### Crash / availability loss

The administrator replays sequences with invalid or far-future timestamps (as per advisory) to see if the server enters a denial-of-service or association refusal loop. Serial console monitored for crash or unresponsiveness.

On observing unavailability, PCAPs and console logs are preserved; relevant indicators (LEDs, UI status) are photographed.

### Bounded protocol message mutations

Low-intensity mutations of MMS messages: altering fields like timestamps, sequence numbers, payload length. Monitor for parsing errors, crashes, or memory leaks (if visible). Any abnormal behaviour triggers capture and halt.

## Evidence handling (probable conventions)

Files are named and stored following pattern:

* `labid_firmware_<version>_<sha256>.bin`
* `labid_baseline_<timestamp>.pcap`
* `labid_trigger_<symptom>_<timestamp>.pcap`
* `labid_console_<event>_<timestamp>.log`
* `labid_iec_assoc_<type>_<timestamp>.txt` — raw IEC association messages or timestamps
* `labid_notes_<step>_<timestamp>.md`

Each artefact is committed to private repo with restricted access and audit trail.

## Mitigation verification (likely procedure)

Vendor patch or configuration mitigation is obtained, checksummed and applied in isolated environment.

The same minimal reproduction steps (timestamp / association tests) are re-executed post-patch. Pre- and post-patch PCAPs and console logs are compared to demonstrate whether the reported issue is resolved or if residual behaviour remains (e.g. association allowed but timestamp checks still lax).

## Forks in the road — decision points and alternatives (explicit)

### Hardware versus emulation

* Most likely chosen: hardware verification to observe real behaviour under timing, IO, power conditions.
* Alternative: emulation first to test timestamp and message parsing; this shifts workflow by enabling fast iteration of mutated MMS messages in emulation, collecting virtual serial output and traffic simulation but later requiring hardware confirmation.

### Depth of timestamp tampering vs auth checks

* Most likely chosen: test timestamp anomalies if advisory indicates forwarding and timestamp checks are involved.
* Alternative: focus first on authentication / association security (certificates, TLS) if advisory is ambiguous; this shifts tests to certificate validation and TLS handshake before touching timestamp mutations.

### Active message mutation vs passive observation

* Most likely chosen: passive capture of normal message flows, then gradual mutation of timestamps or sequence numbers.
* Alternative: aggressive mutation of MMS packets (e.g. fuzz sequence numbers or large timestamps) early; this increases risk of unpredictable behaviour and may require hardware recovery steps.

### Local stub for peer vs full peer network simulation

* Most likely chosen: stub for upstream or peer IEC 61850 association to simulate a minimal peer or server.
* Alternative: fabrication of a full IEC peer environment (multiple servers or clients) to test more complex inter-device interactions; this shifts workflow to require more network configuration and possibly using lab PC to run multiple services.

## Possible technical caveats

* Version reporting in IEC 61850 may be vague; device reported version may differ from firmware image signature. Record both.
* Timestamp or clock drift can mask or exacerbate issues; ensure device and lab host clocks are synchronised or note divergence.
* Serial / console output may not include clear stack traces; capture whatever debug information is available, possibly via enabling verbose logging.
* Tools for extracting IEC 61850 / MMS messages may misdecode if handshake or metadata omitted; ensure captures begin from association request onward.

## Classification outcomes

* Reproducible — full: deterministic reproduction of the DoS or disconnect loop via timestamp tampering or association misuse, with PCAP, console log and firmware hash.
* Reproducible — partial: some symptoms reproduced (e.g. association refused or delay) but not full disconnect loop or crash; limitations documented.
* Not reproducible: hardware/firmware mismatch, or cannot generate the precise message signature or timestamp behaviour named in advisory.
* Not reproducible — claim unsupported: tested according to advisory, no observable effect; discrepancy documented (request, timestamp, sequence, error codes).

## Closing remarks

* This inferred procedure suggests that validating CVE-2025-39203 depends heavily on precise handling of IEC 61850 association, timestamps, and message forwarding logic.
* Deterministic PCAP captures and serial console output are critical to establish that the DoS / disconnect behaviour is real.
* Emulation can speed iteration of parsing-related tests, but real hardware is necessary to observe all sides of the vulnerability (power, watchdogs, timing).
* The validation path most likely places weight on video-proof (status LEDs / device behaviour), serial log outputs and vendor patch validation to satisfy regulatory and disclosure standards.
