| [CVE-2025-30257](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2025-30257)                                                                                                                                      | Smart meters                         | Unauthenticated attackers can retrieve serial numbers of smart meters associated to specific user accounts.                  | Leakage of unique identifiers can help attackers map infrastructure, fingerprint devices, impersonate, or scale attacks.                                      |
| [CVE-2024-43659](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43659)                                                                                                                                      | Iocharger EV chargers (AC models)    | Default credentials used in firmware; password change not mandatory in older versions.                                       | Devices with weak or default auth are widespread entry points. For PoC labs, get a charger with the same firmware version to see how easily it can be abused. |
| [CVE-2021-22713](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-22713)                                                                                                                       | Schneider Electric Smart Meters      | Integer overflow via specially crafted TCP packet → device reboot.                                                           | Availability attacks are real. For edge devices, even reboots disrupt metering, operations, and trust.                                                        |

Full control over charging station. | Devastating if exploited at scale. Must test firmware’s HTTP / network interfaces carefully.                                                                  |
| [CVE-2024-43663](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43663)                                                                                                                                           | Iocharger AC EV chargers             | Multiple buffer overflow flaws in CGI binaries; possible remote code execution.                                              | Edge firmware often uses web-interfaces / CGI; these are classic weak spots. Buffers, input validation, patching are key.                                     |
| [CVE-2024-37310](https://plaxidityx.com/blog/automotive-cyber-security/ev-cyber-security-plaxidityx-discovers-critical-vulnerability-in-everest-open-source-ev-charging-firmware-stack-cve-2024-37310) | EV charging firmware stack (EVerest) | Critical flaw in open-source EV charging framework; could allow control takeover.                                            | Open-source stacks are double-edged: visibility is good, but also exploitation-ready if unpatched. For PoCs, use identical stack versions.                    |
| [CVE-2025-5748 / 5749 / 5750 etc.](https://app.opencve.io/cve/?product=level_2_ev_charger_firmware&vendor=wolfbox)                                                                                     | Wolfbox Level 2 EV Charger           | Remote code execution, authentication bypass, buffer overflow, uninitialized variables, etc.                                 | This cluster shows how many edge devices are exposed via network-adjacent vectors. Great potential case studies.                                              |

## Patterns

1. Firmware version matching: Many vulnerabilities are fixed in later firmware; use the same version as reported.
2. Auth & default credentials: Weak passwords or default ones are common. Try login flows, web UI, APIs.
3. Network exposure: HTTP/Web UI, CGI binaries, local network interfaces are often the attack vectors. Capture traffic and test for them.
4. Buffer overflows and parsing bugs: Protocol parsing, especially for edge-protocols or custom CGI, are frequent weak spots.
5. Device identity leaks: Serial numbers, IDs, firmware version disclosures can aid in reconnaissance and scaling of attacks.
6. Remote code execution / admin access: Once into the device, what else to do? Always test for escalation paths.
