# Forward-looking lab trends table

| Trend                                    | Impact                                                                                        | Lab adaptations                                                                                                     | Evidence practices                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Converged OT/IT security                 | OT devices require IT-style authentication, TLS, patching; traditional isolation insufficient | Emulate full IT/OT stack; include VLAN/SPAN, stub servers, TLS handshake validation                                 | Capture full handshake flows, baseline PCAPs, and serial/console logs; document patch application steps              |
| Automated PoC & evidence capture         | Manual logging is slow, error-prone, auditability suffers                                     | Deploy automation scripts for PCAP, serial logs, firmware hashes, baseline captures; integrate with version control | Timestamped artefacts, auto-archived PCAPs/logs, consistent naming conventions, clear audit trails                   |
| Protocol-specific fuzzing/mutation       | Subtle DoS or replay attacks remain hard to detect                                            | Implement incremental, bounded fuzzing for ICCP/TASE.2, OCPP, Modbus, Zigbee GP; monitor stop conditions            | Capture mutated flows separately, include mutation parameters, record serial/console observations                    |
| Digital twins & emulation-first testing  | Hardware may be expensive, destructive, or scarce                                             | Use QEMU/firmadyne or protocol emulators for rapid iteration; reserve hardware for final validation                 | Archive emulation logs, capture traffic in virtual networks, link to real hardware confirmation results              |
| Evidence-centric vulnerability reporting | CVEs require reproducible proof without exploits                                              | Standardise recipes, checklists, and test matrices; link PoC steps to captured artefacts                            | Full PCAPs, serial logs, firmware/stack hashes, screenshots; all committed to restricted repository with audit trail |
| Integration with larger threat models    | CVEs can have cascading network impacts                                                       | Simulate multi-device networks, smart grid scenarios; include peer stubs or multiple device clusters                | Document network topology, traffic flows, interaction logs; highlight potential upstream/downstream effects          |
| Policy and regulatory pressure           | Validation increasingly mandatory; liability for untested systems                             | Build repeatable, deterministic lab processes; ensure safe, isolated tests and mitigation verification              | Maintain clear pre/post patch comparison, timestamped artefacts, compliance checklists; capture mitigation efficacy  |

This table:

* Keeps lab practices forward-compatible with emerging smart energy device security demands.
* Emphasises safe, deterministic evidence collection over attack-focused testing.
* Tries to figure out where to invest in automation, emulation, and network-level simulation. If not already done, because these comments are based on a [speculative lab](lab.md), so I may be looking backward instead of forward while not minding my feet dancing on quicksand.
