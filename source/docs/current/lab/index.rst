PoC validation
=========================================================

Actual exploit testing, attack simulation, and lab experimentation is handled by:

* Vendors of the affected devices/software
* Reference labs or sector labs (for industrial/critical devices)
* National CSIRTs if the CVE affects national infrastructure

What would minimally be needed in a test lab?
