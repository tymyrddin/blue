# ELK vs OpenSearch stack

## Choosing a data analytics platform

CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) require robust data ingestion and analysis platforms to handle vulnerability reports, case data, and metrics for operational decision-making. While the exact stack used by DIVD is not publicly disclosed, it likely revolves around a powerful search and analytics stack such as ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or its open-source fork OpenSearch. Key requirements include:

* Ingesting and normalizing structured and unstructured case data.
* Generating custom dashboards for analysts, management, and reporting.
* Integrating with incident response platforms (e.g., DFIR-IRIS, TheHive) and threat intelligence sources.
* Ensuring security, auditability, and GDPR/NIS2 compliance.

Both [ELK](https://elastic-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [OpenSearch](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/) stacks are capable, but they differ in licensing, enterprise features, and open-source openness.

## Core features comparison

### ELK Stack

* Elasticsearch: Powerful search engine for indexing and querying case data.
* Logstash: Data ingestion and transformation pipeline.
* Kibana: Dashboarding and visualization with advanced charting, filtering, and reporting.
* Security: Enterprise features (role-based access, encryption, audit logging) available in commercial offerings.
* Extensibility: Rich plugin ecosystem; machine learning and alerting available with paid license.

### OpenSearch Stack

* OpenSearch: Fork of Elasticsearch, fully Apache 2.0 licensed.
* Logstash / Fluentd: Flexible data ingestion options.
* OpenSearch Dashboards: Kibana fork with similar visualization capabilities.
* Security: Built-in authentication, authorization, encryption, and audit logging.
* Extensibility: Plugins and open-source machine learning/anomaly detection available.

## Security considerations

| Aspect                  | ELK Stack                                    | OpenSearch Stack                             |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Authentication & Access | Basic in OSS, advanced in commercial Elastic | Built-in RBAC, TLS, audit logging            |
| Data Protection         | Enterprise encryption requires paid license  | Full encryption and access controls included |
| Audit Logging           | Commercial features only                     | Included and configurable                    |
| GDPR/NIS2 Compliance    | Possible but depends on license and config   | Fully open-source stack easier to audit      |

Speculative: DIVD would prioritise built-in security and audit logging, making OpenSearch attractive. ELK could be used if commercial licensing is acceptable.

## Integration & extensibility

| Integration         | ELK Stack                         | OpenSearch Stack                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Threat Intelligence | Via APIs, plugins, custom scripts | Same via APIs, native integration options |
| Incident Response   | Connect to TheHive / DFIR-IRIS    | Connect to TheHive / DFIR-IRIS            |
| Automation          | Paid machine learning & alerting  | Open-source alerting & anomaly detection  |
| API                 | Full-featured REST APIs           | Comprehensive REST APIs                   |

Speculative: DIVD likely integrates the stack with its CNA workflow, incident response tools, and MISP feeds for enrichment.

## Deployment & scalability

| Aspect      | ELK Stack                                       | OpenSearch Stack                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Deployment  | Docker, Kubernetes, or bare-metal               | Docker, Kubernetes, or bare-metal            |
| Scalability | Mature, enterprise-ready                        | Mature, open-source, flexible                |
| Maintenance | Moderate to high for large deployments          | Moderate, supported by open-source community |
| Flexibility | High with plugins, commercial features optional | High with plugins, fully open-source         |

Speculative: DIVD may use Docker-based deployment for flexibility, with OpenSearch preferred for fully open-source compliance and cost efficiency.

## Cost considerations

| Aspect         | ELK Stack                                         | OpenSearch Stack            |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Licensing      | Commercial features require paid license          | Fully Apache 2.0, free      |
| Implementation | Mature ecosystem, enterprise docs                 | Open-source, community docs |
| Maintenance    | Requires commercial support for advanced features | Community-driven, flexible  |

Speculative: DIVD, as a non-profit, would likely favour OpenSearch for cost-effective, secure, and fully open-source deployment, while ELK could be an alternative if enterprise features justify the expense.

## Informed guess: What DIVD CNA might use

Primary Choice: Likely OpenSearch Stack.

* Fully open-source, aligns with non-profit and transparency principles.
* Built-in security, audit logging, and alerting suitable for GDPR/NIS2 compliance.
* Flexible integration with MISP, DFIR-IRIS, or TheHive.

Alternative/Commercial Option: ELK Stack with commercial licenses.

* Offers polished enterprise features and machine learning capabilities.
* Could be used if DIVD values vendor support or specific commercial analytics capabilities.

DIVD CNA likely balances cost, compliance, and security. OpenSearch Stack fits the open-source ethos while offering enterprise-level features required for CNA operations.
