# Inferred PoC validation paths for CVE-2022-2277

Inferred, defensive validation paths that a CNA administrator most likely follows when validating CVE-2022-2277, 
affecting an ICCP/TASE.2 implementation in Hitachi Energy MicroSCADA X SYS600 (ICCP stack). The descriptions are 
reverse-engineered from advisories and the evenso speculative lab setup. Nothing here claims to be a 
verbatim log; each step is phrased as what is most likely done, observed or recorded. The focus is on 
deterministic observation, evidence collection and mitigation verification without providing (inferred) exploit code.

## Environment and prerequisites (most likely present)

* [Lab setup](../lab/lab.md). 
* Isolation: a dedicated VLAN and a managed switch with SPAN mirroring are configured to prevent accidental interaction with production networks.  
* Hardware likely present: MicroSCADA X SYS600 or equivalent test appliance (matching version/revision where possible), a lab PC for captures and analysis, a Raspberry Pi or small server to host ICCP/TASE.2 peer stubs, serial/TTL adapter for console capture, surge-protected power supply.  
* Software examples installed in the analysis VM: `wireshark` (with ICCP/TASE.2 dissector), `tcpdump`, `nmap`, `socat`, `scapy` (for crafted packet injection), minimal ICCP/TASE.2 test tools or libraries (OpenICCP or custom scripts), `binwalk`, `ghidra`/`gdb` for offline binary analysis.  
* Private evidence repository with naming and access controls is created to manage artefacts.

## Preparatory actions (most likely taken)

1. VLAN and SPAN setup: A test VLAN is configured and the SYS600 port is mirrored to the capture interface. Verification via `ping` and quick `tcpdump -c 100` is performed.

2. Power and console connectivity: Serial console access is attached where available; boot and runtime logs are recorded. Power is from a switched, surge-protected strip.

3. ICCP/TASE.2 peer stub on SBC: Raspberry Pi or lab server runs a minimal ICCP peer/service to emulate an inter-utility partner. If the device expects a specific peer behaviour, the stub implements association and basic data forwarding. DNS/network redirection is used if necessary.

## Baseline data collection (what is likely captured)

* Firmware/stack hash: firmware or relevant binary hashes are computed and recorded.  
* Passive capture: `tcpdump` captures ICCP/TASE.2 traffic during normal association and forwarding operations to produce a baseline pcap.  
* Serial capture: runtime logs and any debug output are saved.  
* Service discovery: port enumeration to confirm ICCP/TASE.2 ports (default and non-standard) and TLS use.  
* Protocol flow capture: full association handshake, data set subscription and forwarding sequences are captured for later mutation.

Baseline artefacts are stored under `/evidence/<labid>/baseline/`.

## Firmware / stack analysis (inferred activities)

* Extract relevant binaries from firmware if possible; search for ICCP/TASE.2 stack modules, timestamp handling, and forwarding code paths.  
* Static inspection (strings, symbol hints) looks for timestamp parsing, sequence handling, and validation logic.  
* Light disassembly of suspected modules in Ghidra focuses on input validation routines and time-related code paths. Deep reversing is deferred unless a crash or unexpected behaviour is observed.

Decision point: if timestamp validation code is evident, plan specific timestamp manipulation tests; if authentication/association weaknesses appear more likely, prioritise association/TLS tests.

## Targeted reconnaissance and minimal reproducibility (inferred tests)

Testing is incremental and fully captured. Reproduction attempts adhere to strict stop conditions.

### Association and authentication checks

Capture and inspect ICCP/TASE.2 association handshake (link establishment, capabilities exchange). Determine whether the implementation requires mutual authentication (certs/TLS) or allows unauthenticated associations. Raw association messages are recorded.

### Timestamp forwarding and manipulation tests

Observe normal forwarding behaviour: how timestamps are handled when data is forwarded between peers (time fields, forwarding metadata).  

Inject messages with timestamps far in the future (or malformed timestamp formats) using controlled, incremental steps to observe whether the receiver misbehaves or enters an error/DoS condition. Each injected message and response is captured. Serial console and service availability are monitored.

### Crash / denial-of-service observation

Replay the advisory-informed sequences or crafted timestamp-anomalous frames while monitoring service availability. On observed unavailability (service hang, crash, association loop), capture PCAPs, serial console logs and any UI/indicator state.

### Bounded protocol mutation

Mutate non-time fields (sequence numbers, dataset lengths) in small, controlled increments to verify whether other fields trigger failure modes. All mutations stop immediately on non-deterministic or destructive outcomes.

## Evidence handling (probable conventions)

Files follow a strict naming convention, for example:

* `labid_stack_<version>_<sha256>.bin`  
* `labid_baseline_ippcap_<timestamp>.pcap`  
* `labid_trigger_iccp_timestamp_<timestamp>.pcap`  
* `labid_console_<event>_<timestamp>.log`  
* `labid_iccp_assoc_<timestamp>.txt` — raw association messages and decoded fields  
* `labid_notes_<step>_<timestamp>.md`

Artefacts are committed to a private repository with ACLs and an audit trail.

## Mitigation verification (likely procedure)

Vendor patch, configuration change or recommended mitigation is obtained and checksummed.  

The patch is applied in the isolated environment and the same timestamp/association reproduction steps are re-executed. Pre/post PCAPs and console logs are compared to demonstrate remediation or residual weaknesses.

## Forks in the road — decision points and alternatives (explicit)

### Hardware versus emulation

* Most likely chosen: hardware verification to observe real networking stacks, timing, and watchdog behaviour.  
* Alternative: emulation first to iterate on timestamp mutation and parsing logic quickly.  
 * How this shifts the workflow: emulation-first uses extracted stack binaries or a simulated ICCP peer to run rapid mutations of association and forwarded messages. Evidence concentrates on emulated logs and decoded messages; successful emulation reproduction prompts hardware confirmation. Failure in emulation triggers a shift to hardware testing to capture hardware-dependent issues.

### Association/TLS checks versus timestamp focus

* Most likely chosen: focus on timestamp forwarding if advisory specifically implicates timestamps.  
* Alternative: prioritise association authentication and TLS handshake checks if advisory is unclear.  
 * How this shifts the workflow: prioritising TLS/association requires certificate inspection, TLS handshake manipulation (cipher suites, renegotiation), and verification of mutual authentication; timestamp tests are deferred until association hardening is confirmed.

### Passive capture then mutation versus immediate active tests

* Most likely chosen: passive capture to establish normal flows, followed by bounded mutations.  
* Alternative: immediate active mutation to stress the stack early.  
 * How this shifts the workflow: immediate mutation speeds discovery but increases chance of instability. The lab must prepare recovery and device replacement plans, and triage workload increases due to noisy outputs.

### Local peer stub versus multi-peer simulation

* Most likely chosen: single local peer stub to emulate the minimal forwarding behaviour.  
* Alternative: build a multi-peer testbed to simulate complex forwarding topologies and aggregated timestamp flows.  
 * How this shifts the workflow: multi-peer simulation requires more network orchestration, increases capture complexity, and produces richer data sets to test forwarding edge cases that single-peer tests might miss.

### Tool isolation strategy

* Most likely chosen: analysis tools run in isolated VMs separate from the capture host.  
* Alternative: run analysis directly on the capture host for convenience.  
 * How this shifts the workflow: VM isolation enforces read-only capture handling and a push-pull model for derived artefacts; running on capture host collapses steps and requires immediate integrity checks and backups to avoid evidence contamination.

## Possible technical caveats

* ICCP/TASE.2 implementations vary; message encodings and vendor extensions can complicate decoding. Use of proper dissectors and correlation from association start is essential.  
* Timestamp formats and epoch references may differ; ensure test messages use the correct field encoding.  
* Clock skew and NTP offsets can affect behaviour; document lab clock state and consider forcing clock offsets in stubs to reproduce the advisory scenario.  
* Some stacks perform internal rate-limiting or protective counters that mask reproducibility; observe stateful counters and reset sequences.

## Classification outcomes

* Reproducible — full: deterministic DoS or association failure via timestamp or forwarding messages, with PCAP, console log and stack hash.  
* Reproducible — partial: degraded behaviour (delayed forwarding, association retries) but not full service denial; document limitations.  
* Not reproducible: cannot reproduce due to firmware/stack mismatch or inability to craft precise forwarded timestamp messages.  
* Not reproducible — claim unsupported: tests conducted per advisory produce no observable effect; discrepancies documented (association fields, timestamps, error codes).

## Closing remarks

* Validating CVE-2022-2277 most likely depends on precise handling of ICCP/TASE.2 associations, timestamp encoding and forwarding logic.  
* Deterministic PCAPs and console output remain the primary evidence for availability or association failures.  
* Emulation accelerates protocol parsing tests, but hardware confirmation is required to capture timing, watchdog and stack protection behaviours.  
* The inferred validation path favours conservative mutation, good evidence hygiene and vendor coordination to satisfy disclosure and regulatory expectations.
