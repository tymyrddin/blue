# Python web framework security comparison

1. Django

Security strengths:

* "Batteries-included" security: Built-in protections against OWASP Top 10 risks (CSRF, XSS, SQLi)
* Automatic escaping in templates (no |safe = no XSS)
* ORM prevents SQL injection by default
* Clickjacking/XSS/CSRF middleware enabled by default

Weaknesses:

* Complex settings can lead to misconfigurations (e.g., DEBUG=True in production)
* Monolithic design increases attack surface

Key security features:

* django-admin startproject enables security middleware by default
* Password hashing (PBKDF2/Argon2) built-in
* Official Security Docs

2. Flask

Security strengths:

* Minimalist core = smaller attack surface
* Explicit security controls (no "magic")

Weaknesses:

* No built-in protections: CSRF, SQLi, and XSS rely on extensions
* Template escaping requires MarkupSafe or manual escape()
* Easy to misconfigure (e.g., app.secret_key hardcoded)

Key security features:

* flask-talisman for HTTPS/CSP headers
* flask-seasurf for CSRF protection
* Flask Security Checklist

3. FastAPI

Security strengths:

* Automatic input validation (Pydantic models)
* OAuth2/JWT built-in (via fastapi.security)
* Async reduces thread-based attacks

Weaknesses:

* Dependency injection complexity can introduce risks
* Young ecosystem (fewer battle-tested security extensions)

Key security features:

* SQLAlchemy ORM integration prevents SQLi
* uvicorn with --ssl-keyfile for HTTPS
* Security Docs

4. Pyramid

Security strengths:

* Flexible auth (ACL-based permissions)
* Less magic = fewer hidden attack vectors

Weaknesses:

* Steeper learning curve for security controls
* Smaller community = slower CVE patches

Key security features:

* pyramid_debugtoolbar for dev-time checks
* pyramid_jwt for stateless auth

## Critical security comparison

| Framework	 | XSS Protection	 | CSRF Default	 | SQLi Protection	 | Auth System	 | CVE History |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Django	    | Auto-escaping	  | Enabled	      | ORM	             | Built-in	    | Low         | 
| Flask	     | Manual	         | Extension	    | Extension        | Extension    | Medium      | 
| FastAPI	   | Pydantic	       | Depends	      | SQLAlchemy	      | OAuth2/JWT	  | Low         | 
| Pyramid	   | Manual	         | Extension	    | SQLAlchemy	      | ACL-based	   | Very Low    | 

## Framework-specific threats

Django:

* Misconfigured `ALLOWED_HOSTS` → header injection
* `pickle` serialization risks in caching

Flask:

* `app.debug=True` leaks stack traces
* Unsafe `jsonify()` with user input

FastAPI:

* Dependency injection abuse
* OpenAPI/Swagger exposure in prod

Pyramid:

* Complex ACL rules → permission errors
* Less auto-escaping in templates

## Universal Python risks

* Dependency hijacking (PyPI malware) → Use pip-audit
* WSGI servers (gunicorn/uWSGI) need hardening
* Secret management (avoid .env files in prod)

## Recommendations

* Enterprise apps: Django (batteries-included security)
* Microservices: FastAPI (async + Pydantic validation)
* Prototyping: Flask (but add security extensions)
* Flexibility needed: Pyramid (for custom auth)

All frameworks require:

* Content-Security-Policy headers
* Regular safety check scans
* HTTPS enforcement (redirect HTTP → HTTPS)

## Tools for hardening

* Django: django-security (middleware package)
* Flask: flask-seasurf (CSRF), flask-talisman (CSP)
* FastAPI: secure (headers middleware)
* All: bandit (static analysis), safety (vuln scans)
