# Security testing for development

## Why security testing matters

Security testing isn't optional - it's critical for:

* Preventing costly breaches before they happen
* Meeting compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
* Maintaining customer trust in your products
* Reducing technical debt from security flaws

## Implementing security testing

| Stage	       | Tests                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Design	      | Threat modeling, architecture review | 
| Development	 | SAST, code reviews, SCA              |
| Pre-Prod	    | DAST, penetration testing            |
| Production	  | RASP, continuous monitoring          |

## Automation is Key

* Integrate security tools into CI/CD pipelines
* Fail builds on critical vulnerabilities
* Use policy-as-code for enforcement

## Getting started checklist

* Add SAST scanning to your CI pipeline
* Schedule monthly penetration tests
* Implement dependency scanning
* Train developers on secure code reviews
* Monitor production for new vulnerabilities
