# Lockdown in application security: A strategic approach

In application security, lockdown refers to the systematic hardening of an applicationâ€™s environment, configurations, 
and runtime to minimize attack surfaces. It combines preventive controls (e.g., least privilege, input validation) 
with detective measures (e.g., logging, anomaly detection) to enforce strict operational boundaries.

## Why lockdown matters

* Mitigates exploitation: Limits damage from vulnerabilities (e.g., zero-days, misconfigurations).
* Compliance alignment: Meets standards like NIST 800-53, PCI DSS, and OWASP ASVS.
* Resilience against lateral movement: Critical for containment in breaches.
