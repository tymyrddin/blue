# Multifactor authentication news (2020-2022)

Using the big ones as indicators of what might lay ahead in the global 'digitally trapped' infrastructure. 

## LastPass

LastPass' [3RD ANNUAL GLOBAL PASSWORD SECURITY REPORT](https://lp-cdn.lastpass.com/lporcamedia/document-library/lastpass/pdf/en/LMI0828a-IAM-LastPass-State-of-the-Password-Report.pdf) boasting "Emerging trends in access and authentication
in businesses worldwide" (based on surveys), concludes that hat businesses in the technology and software industry were 
the most proactive in using MFA, with 39% of respondents stating they were already using it. Education closely followed 
with 33%, but worryingly, the industries that handle some of the most sensitive customer data – legal and insurance had 
much less uptake of MFA, both with only 20% of employees using the authentication method.

A password manager makes life much simpler if you have trouble remembering passwords (forgetting is easy with 40+ accounts). 
To avoid your account being hacked, it’s generally good practice to use a different password for each account you use. 
If a hacker guesses one password correctly, chances are they can use the same login credentials to log in to your 
account on other services. Unfortunately, LastPass reports that over half of us recycle the same password across 
multiple accounts.

## Google

End of 2021, Google auto-enrolled 150 million users into using two-factor authentication to access their accounts. 
According to [9to5 Google](https://9to5google.com/2022/02/08/google-account-2sv/), this resulted in a 50% decline in 
compromised accounts.

Google's [13 best practices for user account, authentication, and password management, 2021 edition](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/account-authentication-and-password-management-best-practices) 
promises shows that multifactor authentication **almost** eliminates the possibility of your account being hacked. 
Almost. More sophisticated attacks may still penetrate the 2FA line of defense.

October 2021, Google is [Delivering 10,000 security keys to high risk users](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/delivering-10000-security-keys-high-risk-users/) to encourage people to join its "advanced protection programme" for high-profile users.

## Twitter

[Twitter’s 2021 transparency report](https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/account-security.html#2021-jan-jun) reveals that its two-factor authentication method uptake is surprisingly low. 
In its reporting period between July and December 2020, a meager 2.5% of users adopted 2FA. And 77% of users who adopted 
two-factor authentication use SMS, 30.1% use an authenticator app, and only 0.5% use a security key.

## Facebook

Facebook-owner Meta reported in December 2021 it will begin requiring its highest-profile and highest-risk users to 
protect their accounts with two-factor authentication. The new security requirement will apply to users of Facebook 
Protect, a feature offered to human rights activists, journalists, government officials and other high-profile users 
deemed likely to be targeted by adversaries. The feature also monitors accounts for hacking threats.

Some Facebook users who opened their app or logged onto the website on March 1st, 2022 were greeted by a pop-up telling 
them they needed to enroll in Facebook Protect by March 17th or their account would be locked. 
On their [Meta newsroom](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/expanding-facebook-protect-to-more-countries/) website: 

> "These people are at the center of critical communities for public debate. They enable democratic elections, 
> hold governments and organizations accountable, and defend human rights around the world. Unfortunately, this 
> also means that they are highly targeted by bad actors."
