# Statistics on BYOD in organisations (2017–2022)

## Notes for building security cultures

Allowing employees to choose their preferred make and model of the device they use at work is likely to be more 
productive than using a device they are less comfortable with. If you want employees to be more engaged in 
building a security culture, treat them as responsible adults that can make their own choices.
